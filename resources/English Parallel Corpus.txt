1. How wonderful it is to watch the sky after sunset
2. One would first notice one or two bright dots shining in the sky. Soon you would see the number increasing.
3. You cannot count them any more.
4. The whole sky is filled with tiny shining objects – some are bright, others dim.
5. It seems as if the sky is studded with diamonds.
6. They all appear to be twinkling
7. But if you look at them carefully you will notice that some of them do not twinkle as others do.
8. They simply glow without any flicker just as the moon shines.
9. Along with these bright objects, you may also see the moon on most of the days
10. It may, however, appear at different times, in different shapes and at different positions
11. You can see the full moon only once in about a month’s time.
12. It is Full moon night or Poornima.
13. A fortnight later, you cannot see it at all.
14. It is a New moon night or Amavasya
15. On this day, you can watch the night sky best, provided it is a clear night.
16. Do you wonder why can’t we see the moon and all those bright tiny objects during the day time?
17. It is because the very bright light of the sun does not allow us to see all these bright objects of the night sky.
18. The sun, the moon and all those objects shining in the night sky are called celestial bodies.
19. Some celestial bodies are very big and hot.
20. They are made up of gases.
21. They have their own heat and light, which they emit in large amounts.
22. These celestial bodies are called stars.
23. The sun is a star.
24. Countless twinkling stars in the night sky are similar to the sun
25. But we do not feel their heat or light, and they look so tiny because they are very very far from us.
26. You must have noticed that all objects look smaller when seen from a distance
27. How small an aeroplane looks when it is flying at a great height!
28. While watching the night sky, you may notice various patterns formed by different groups of stars.
29. These are called constellations.
30. Ursa Major or Big Bear is one such constellation.
31. One of the most easily recognisable constellation
32. it is a group of seven stars that forms a part ofUrsa Major Constellation
33. Ask someone elder in your family or neighbourhood to show you more stars, planets and constellations in the sky.
34. In ancient times, people used to determine directions during the night with the help of stars.
35. The North star indicates the north direction.
36. It is also called the Pole Star.
37. It always remains in the same position in the sky
38. We can locate the position of the Pole Star with the help of the Saptarishi
39. Look at Figure You will notice that, if an imaginary line is drawn joining the pointer stars and extended further, it will point to the Pole Star.
40. Some celestial bodies do not have their own heat and light.
41. They are lit by the light of the stars.
42. Such bodies are called planets.
43. The word ‘planet’ comes from the Greek word “Planetai” which means ‘wanderers’.
44. The earth on which we live is a planet.
45. It gets all its heat and light from the sun, which is our nearest star.
46. If we look at the earth from a great distance, say the moon, it will appear to be shining just as the moon.
47. The moon that we see in the sky is a satellite
48. It is a companion of our earth and moves around it.
49. Like our earth, there are seven other planets that get heat and light from the sun. Some of them have their moons too.
50. Some of them have their moons too.
51. The sun, eight planets, satellites and some other celestial bodies known as asteroids and meteoroids form the solar system
52. We often call it a solar family, with the sun as its Head.
53. The sun is in the centre of the solar system
54. It is huge and made up of extremely hot gases.
55. It provides the pulling force that binds the solar system.
56. The sun is the ultimate source of heat and light for the solar system.
57. The sun is the ultimate source of heat and light for the solar system. But that tremendous heat is not felt so much by us because despite being our nearest star, it is far away from us.
58. The sun is about 150 million km away from the earth.
59. There are eight planets in our solar system
60. In order of their distance from the sun, they are: Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune.
61. All the eight planets of the solar system move around the sun in fixed paths.
62. These paths are elongated. They are called orbits.
63. Mercury is nearest to the sun.
64. takes only about 88 days to complete one round along its orbit
65. Venus is considered as Earth’s-twin’ because its size and shape are very much similar to that of the earth.
66. Till recently Pluto was also considered a planet
67. However, in a meeting of the International Astronomical Union, a decision was taken that Pluto, like other celestial objects Ceres, 2003 discovered in recent past may be called "dwarf planets.”
68. The earth is the third nearest planet to the sun.
69. In size, it is the fifth largest planet.
70. it is slightly flattened at the poles
71. That is why, its shape is described as a Geoid. Geoid means an earth-like shape
72. Geoid means an earth-like shape
73. Conditions favourable to support life are probably found only on the earth.
74. The earth is neither too hot nor too cold.
75. It has water and air, which are very essential for our survival.
76. The air has life-supporting gases like oxygen.
77. Because of these reasons, the earth is a unique planet in the solar system.
78. From outer space, the earth appears blue because its two-thirds surface is covered by water. 
79. therefore, called a blue planet.
80. Our earth has only one satellite, that is, the moon.
81. Its diameter is only one-quarter that of the earth.
82. It appears so big because it is nearer to our planet than other celestial bodies.
83. It is about 3,84,400 km away from us.
84. The moon moves around the earth in about 27 days.
85. It takes exactly the same time to complete one spin
86.  As a result, only one side of the moon is visible to us on the earth.
87. Now you can compare the distance of the earth from the sun and that from the moon.
88. The moon does not have conditions favourable for life.
89. It has mountains, plains and depressions on its surface. These cast shadows on the moon’s surface.
90. Look at the full moon and observe these shadows.
91. Apart from the stars, planets and satellites, there are numerous tiny bodies which also move around the sun.
92. These bodies are called asteroids.
93. They are found between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter .
94. Scientists are of the view that asteroids are parts of a planet which exploded many years back.
95. The small pieces of rocks which move around the sun are called meteoroids.
96. Sometimes these meteoroids come near the earth and tend to drop upon it.
97. During this process due to friction with the air they get heated up and burn.
98. It causes a flash of light
99. Sometimes, a meteor without being completely burnt, falls on the earth and creates a hollow.
100. Do you see a whitish broadband, like a white glowing path across the sky on a clear starry night?
101.  It is a cluster of millions of stars.
102. This band is the Milky
103. Our solar system is a part of this galaxy.
104. In ancient India, it was imagined to be a river of light flowing in the sky.
105. Thus, it was named Akash Ganga.
106. A galaxy is a huge system of billions of stars, and clouds of dust and gasses.
107. There are millions of such galaxies that make the Universe.
108. It is difficult to imagine how big the universe is.
109. Scientists are still trying to find out more and more about it.
110. We are not certain about its size but we know that all of us – you and I belong to this universe.
111. How does a planet differ from a star?
112.  What is meant by the ‘Solar System’?
113.  Name all the planets according to their distance from the sun.
114.  Why is the Earth called a unique planet?
115.  Why do we see only one side of the moon always?
116. What is the Universe ?
117. The planet known as the “Earth’s Twin” is?
118. Which is the third nearest planet to the sun ?
119. All the planets move around the sun in which path?
120. The Pole Star indicates which direction
121. Asteroids are found between orbits. Which planet ?
122. Prepare a chart of the solar system.
123. During a vacation visit a planetarium and describe your experience in the class.
124. Organise a quiz contest on the earth and the solar system.        
125. In the previous chapter, you have read that our planet earth is not a sphere.                                                
126. It is slightly flattened at the North and the South Poles and bulges in the middle.                                                
127. Can you imagine how it looks?                                                
128. You may look at a globe carefully in your classroom to get an idea.                                                
129. Globe is a true model (miniature form) of the earth.                                                
130. Globes may be of varying size and type – big ones, which cannot be carried easily, small pocket globes, and globe-like balloons, which can be inflated and are handy and carried with ease.                                                
131. The globe is not fixed.                                                
132. it can be rotated the same way as a top spin or a potter’s wheel is rotated.                                                
133. On the globe, countries, continents and oceans are shown in their correct size.                                                
134. It is difficult to describe the location of a point on a sphere like the earth.                                                
135. Now the question arises as to how to locate a place on it?                                                
136. We need certain points of reference and lines to find out the location of places.                                                
137. You will notice that a needle is fixed through the globe in a tilted manner, which is called its axis.                                                
138. Two points on the globe through which the needle passes are two poles – North Pole and South Pole.                                                
139. The globe can be moved around this needle from west to east just as the earth moves.                                                
140. But, remember there is a major difference.                                                
141. The real earth has no such needle.                                                
142. It moves around its axis, which is an imaginary line.                                                
143. Another imaginary line running on the globe divides it into two equal parts.                                                
144. This line is known as the equator.                                                
145. The northern half of the earth is known as the Northern Hemisphere and the southern half is known as the Southern Hemisphere.                                                
146. They are both equal halves.                                                
147. Therefore, the equator is an imaginary circular line and is a very important reference point to locate places on the earth.                                                
148. All parallel circles from the equator up to the poles are called parallels of latitudes.                                                
149. Latitudes are measured in degrees.                                                
150. The equator represents the zero degree latitude.                                                
151. Since the distance from the equator to either of the poles is one-fourth of a circle round the earth, it will measure ¼ th of 360 degrees, i.e. 90°.                                                
152. Thus, 90 degrees north latitude marks the North Pole and 90 degrees south latitude marks the South Pole.                                                
153. As such, all parallels north of the Latitude equator are called ‘north latitudes.’                                                
154. Similarly all parallels south of the equator are called ‘south latitudes.                                                
155. Generally, this is indicated by the letter ‘N’ or ‘S’.                                                
156. For example, both Chandrapur in Maharashtra (India) and Belo Horizonte in Brazil (South America) are located on parallels of about 20° latitude.                                                
157. But the former is 20° north of the equator and the latter is 20° south of it.                                                
158. We, therefore, say that Chandrapur is situated at 20° N latitude and Belo Horizonte is situated at 20° S latitude.                                                
159. We see in Figure 2.2 that as we move away from the equator, the size of the parallels of latitude decreases.                                                
160. The mid-day sun is exactly overhead at least once a year on all latitudes in between the Tropic of Cancer and the Tropic of Capricorn.                                                
161. This area, therefore, receives the maximum heat and is called the Torrid Zone.                                                
162. The mid-day sun never shines overhead on any latitude beyond the Tropic of Cancer and the Tropic of Capricorn.                                                
163. The angle of the sun’s rays goes on decreasing towards the poles.                                                
164. As such, the areas bounded by the Tropic of Cancer and the Arctic Circle in the Northern Hemisphere, and the Tropic of Capricorn and the Antarctic Circle in the Southern Hemisphere, have moderate temperatures.                                                
165. These are, therefore, called Temperate Zones.                                                
166. Areas lying between the Arctic Circle and the North Pole in the Northern Hemisphere and the Antarctic Circle and the South Pole in the Southern Hemisphere, are very cold.                                                
167. It is because here the sun does not rise much above the horizon.                                                
168. To fix the position of a place, it is necessary to know something more than the latitude of that place.                                                
169. You can see, for example, that Tonga Islands (in the Pacific Ocean) and Mauritius Islands (in the Indian Ocean) are situated on the same latitude (i.e., 20° S).                                                
170. Now, in order to locate them precisely, we must find out how far east or west these places are from a given line of reference running from the North Pole to the South Pole.                                                
171. These lines of references are called the meridians of longitude,and the distances between them are measured in ‘degrees of longitude.’                                                
172. Each degree is further divided into minutes, and minutes into seconds.                                                
173. They are semicircles and the distance between them decreases steadily polewards until it becomes zero at the poles, where all the meridians meet.                                                
174. Unlike parallels of latitude, all meridians are of length.                                                
175. Thus, it was difficult to number the meridians.                                                
176. Hence, all countries decided that the count should begin from the meridian which passed through Greenwich, where the British Royal Observatory is located.                                                
177. This meridian is called the Prime Meridian.                                                
178. Its value is 0° longitude and from it we count 180° eastward as well as 180° westward.                                                
179. The Prime Meridian and 180° meridian divide the earth into two equal halves, the Eastern Hemisphere and the Western Hemisphere.                                                
180. Therefore, the longitude of a place is followed by the letter E for the east and W for the west.                                                
181. It is, however, interesting to note that 180° East and 180° West meridians are on the same line.                                                
182. Now look at the grid of the parallels of latitude and meridians of longitude on the globe (Figure 2.6).                                                
183. You can locate any point on the globe very easily if you know its latitude and longitude.                                                
184. For example, Dhubri in Assam is situated at 26° N latitude and 90° E longitude.                                                
185. Find out the point where these two lines cut each other.                                                
186. That point will be the location of Dhubri.                                                
187. To understand this clearly draw equidistant vertical and horizontal lines on a paper (Figure 2.7).                                                
188. Label the vertical rows with numbers and horizontal rows with letters.                                                
189. draw some small circles randomly on points where these horizontal and vertical lines intersect each other.                                                
190. Name these small circles as a, b, c, d and e.                                                
191. Let vertical lines represent East Longitudes and horizontal lines as North Latitudes.                                                
192. Now you will see that circle ‘a’ is located on B ° N latitude and 1 ° E longitude.                                                
193. Find out the location of other circles.                                                
194. The best means of measuring time is by the movement of the earth, the moon and the planets.                                                
195. The sun regularly rises and sets every day.                                                
196. and naturally, it is the best time-keeper throughout the world.                                                
197. Local time can be reckoned by the shadow cast by the sun, which is the shortest at noon and longest at sunrise and sunset.                                                
198. When the Prime Meridian of Greenwich has the sun at the highest point in the sky, all the places along this meridian will have midday or noon.                                                
199. As the earth rotates from west to east, those places east of Greenwich will be ahead of Greenwich time and those to the west will be behind it (Figure 2.8).                                                
200. The rate of difference can be calculated as follows.                                                
201. The earth rotates 360° in about 24 hours, which means 15° an hour or 1° in four minutes.                                                
202. Thus, when it is 12 noon at Greenwich, the time at 15° east of Greenwich will be 15 × 4 = 60 minutes, i.e., 1 hour ahead of Greenwich time, which means 1 p.m.                                                
203. But at 15° west of Greenwich, the time will be behind Greenwich time by one hour, i.e., it will be 11.00 a.m.                                                
204. Similarly, at 180°, it will be midnight when it is 12 noon at Greenwich.                                                
205. At any place a watch can be adjusted to read 12 o’clock when the sun is at the highest point in the sky, i.e., when it is mid-day.                                                
206. The time shown by such a watch will give the local time for that place.                                                
207. You can see that all the places on a given meridian of longitude have the same local time.                                                
208. WHY DO WE HAVE STANDARD TIME ?                                                
209. The local time of places which are on different meridians are bound to differ.                                                
210. For example, it will be difficult to prepare a time-table for trains which cross several longitudes.                                                
211. In India, for instance, there will be a difference of about 1 hour and 45 minutes in the local times of Dwarka in Gujarat and Dibrugarh in Assam.                                                
212. It is, therefore, necessary to adopt the local time of some central meridian of a country as the standard time for the country.                                                
213. The local time at this meridian is taken as the standard time for the whole country.                                                
214. It is known as the Indian Standard Time (IST).                                                
215. Kabeer lives in a small town near Bhopal.                                                
216. He tells his friend Alok that they will not be able to sleep tonight.                                                
217. A day and night cricket match between India and England had started at 2 p.m. in London.                                                
218. This means that the match would begin at 7.30 p.m. in India and finish well into the night.                                                
219. Do you know what is the time difference between India and England?                                                
220. India located east of Greenwich at 82 ° 30 ' E is 5 hours and 30 minutes ahead of GMT.                                                
221. So it will be 7:30 p.m. in India when it is 2:00 p.m. noon in London.                                                
222. Some countries have a great longitudinal extent and so they have adopted more than one standard time.                                                
223. For example, in Russia, there are as many as eleven standard times.                                                
224. The earth has been divided into twenty-four time zones of one hour each.                                                
225. Each zone thus covers 15° of longitude.                                                
226. Answer the following questions briefly.                                                
227. What is the true shape of the earth?                                                
228. What is the latitudinal value of the Tropic of Cancer?                                                
229. What are the three heat zones of the Earth?                                                
230. What are parallels of latitude and meridians of longitude?                                                
231. Why does the torrid zone receive the maximum amount of heat?                                                
232. Why is it 5.30 p.m. in India and 12.00 noon in London?
233. As you know, there are two types of motion of the earth – rotation and rotation.
234. The rotation of the earth on its axis is called rotation.
235. The motion of the earth in a fixed orbit around the sun is called revolution
236. Earth's axis is an imaginary line, which makes an angle of (66 1/2 )° with its orbital surface.
237. The plane made by the orbital is called the orbital plane.
238. Earth receives light from the Sun.
239. The shape of the earth is like a sphere, so only half of it receives sunlight at a time; Fig. (3.2).
240. The side facing the sun has day, while the other side which is away from the sun has night.
241. The circle on the globe that divides day and night is called the circle of illumination.
242. This circle does not coincide with the axis as you can see in Fig. 3.2.
243. The Earth takes about 24 hours to complete one revolution on its axis.
244. The period of rotation is called an Earth day.
245. This is the daily motion of the earth.
246. What happens if the earth doesn't rotate?
247. The part of the Earth facing the Sun will always have a day, due to which the heat will be constant in that part.
248. The second part will always be dark and cold the whole time.
249. Life would not be possible in such a state.
250. The second motion of the earth in its orbit around the sun is called revolution.
251. The Earth revolves around the Sun in a year or 365(1/4) days.
252. We consider a year to be 365 days and do not add 6 hours to it for convenience.
253. In four years, the remaining 6 hours of each year together become equal to one day i.e. 24 hours.
254. This extra day is added to the month of February.
255. In this way, every fourth year February has 29 days instead of 28.
256. A year in which there are 366 days is called a leap year.
257. Find out when will be the next leap year?
258. It is clear from Figure 3.3 that the Earth revolves around the Sun on an elliptical path.
259. Note that the earth is tilted in the same direction throughout the orbit.
260. Generally a year is divided into summer, winter, spring and autumn.
261. Changes in seasons are caused by changes in the position of the Earth around the Sun.
262. In Fig. 3.3 You will see that on 21st June the Northern Hemisphere is tilted towards the Sun.
263. The sun's rays fall directly on the Tropic of Cancer.
264. As a result, more heat is received in these areas.
265. Areas near the poles receive less heat because the sun's rays fall obliquely there.
266. The North Pole is tilted towards the Sun and there is a continuous day for about 6 months on the parts after the North Pole line.
267. Since a large part of the Northern Hemisphere receives sunlight, the northern part of the equator has a summer season.
268. June 21 has the longest day and shortest night in these regions.
269. This state of the earth is called post solstice.
270. On December 22, due to the tilt of the South Pole towards the Sun, the rays of the Sun fell directly on the Tropic of Capricorn.
271. Since the Sun's rays fall vertically on the Tropic of Capricorn, a large part of the Southern Hemisphere receives light.
272. Therefore, the Southern Hemisphere has summers with long days and short nights
273. The exact opposite is the case in the Northern Hemisphere.
274. This state of the earth is called the southern solstice.
275. Do you know that Christmas is celebrated in Australia in the summer season?
276. On March 21 and September 23, the sun's rays fall directly on the equator.
277. In this state, none of the poles is tilted towards the Sun, so night and day are equal on the whole earth.
278. This is called the equinox.
279. On September 23, autumn occurs in the Northern Hemisphere, while it is spring in the Southern Hemisphere.
280. On March 21, the situation is reversed when it is spring in the Northern Hemisphere and autumn in the Southern Hemisphere.
281. Thus, it is clear that due to the rotation and rotation of the earth, there is a change in the day and night and the seasons.
282. After a long vacation when Ravi started going to school again, he noticed that the only playground next to his school was dug up.                                                        
283. वही एक मैदान उनके खेलने के लिए वहाँ पर था।                                                        
284. People said that a huge building with many flats will be constructed there.                                                        
285. Ravi was almost in tears, when he realised that the big playground with its soft grass marigolds and butterflies is gone forever.                                                        
286. He shared his feeling with his classmates.                                                        
287. In the Assembly the principal too sadly observed "see how our environment is changing."                                                        
288. In the class, Ravi asked his teacher "What is the environment?"                                                        
289. Whatever you see in your surroundings. said the teacher.                                                        
290. Ravi thought aloud, "That means, the school building, tables, chairs in the classroom, even that open field, the road, the garbage, my friends all are parts of our environment."                                                        
291. Yes, said the teacher, "but wait some objects are created by nature for example mountains, rivers, trees, animals.                                                        
292. Others are made by people for example roads, cars, clothes books".                                                        
293. Now work in pairs.                                                        
294. Make a list with your classmates sitting next to you, of the creations of nature by human beings.                                                        
295. Environment is our basic life support system.                                                        
296. It provides the air we breathe, the water we drink, the food we eat and the land where we live.                                                        
297. How do human beings modify this natural environment?                                                        
298. The car fumes pollute the air, water is collected in the pot, food is served in vessels and land is used to build factories.                                                        
299. Human beings make cars, Mills, factories and manufacture containers.                                                        
300. This is how human beings modified the natural environment.                                                        
301. Ravi, Paramjeet, Jessy, Mustafa, Asha were all excited about making the list.                                                        
302. Why is our environment changing? asked Iqbal.                                                        
303. It's all of our needs.                                                        
304. They are increasing day by day                                                        
305. we are therefore modifying and at times even destroying our natural surroundings, the teacher replied.                                                        
306. From the above conversation you understand that the place, people, things and nature that surround any living organism is called the environment.                                                        
307. It is a combination of natural and human made phenomena.                                                        
308. While the natural environment refers to both biotic and abiotic conditions existing on earth, human environment reveals the activities, creations and interactions among human beings                                                        
309. Land, water, air, plants and animals compromise the natural environment.                                                        
310. You are familiar with the meaning of lithosphere, Hydrosphere, atmosphere and biosphere from your previous class.                                                        
311. Let us learn some more facts about these domains.                                                        
312. Lithosphere is the solid crust or the hard top layer of the earth.                                                        
313. It is made up of Rocks and Minerals and covered by a thin layer of soil.                                                        
314. It is an irregular surface with various landforms such as mountains, plateaus, plains, valleys, etc.                                                        
315. Landforms are found over the continents and also on the ocean floors.                                                        
316. Lithosphere is the domain that provides us with forests, grasslands for grazing, land for agriculture and human settlements.                                                        
317. It is also a source of mineral wealth.                                                        
318. The domain of water is referred to as a Hydrosphere.                                                        
319. It comprises various sources of water and different types of water bodies like rivers, Lakes, seas, Oceans, etc.                                                        
320. It is essential for all living organisms.                                                        
321. The atmosphere is the thin layer of air that surrounds the Earth.                                                        
322. The gravitational force of the earth holds the atmosphere around it.                                                        
323. It protects us from the harmful rays and scorching heat of the sun.                                                        
324. It consists of a number of gases, dust and water vapour.                                                        
325. The changes in the atmosphere produce changes in the weather and climate.                                                        
326. Plant and Animal kingdom together make biosphere or the living world.                                                        
327. It is a narrow zone of earth where land, water and air interact with each other to support life.                                                        
328. What is the ecosystem?                                                        
329. At an NCC camp that Ravi's class was attending Jessy exclaimed, what a heavy downpour.                                                        
330. It reminds me of my home in Kerala.                                                        
331. You should come and see how it pours and pours and pours over the lush Green Fields and coconut plantations.                                                        
332. Heera from Jaisalmer exclaimed, We get no rains.                                                        
333. We only see KiKar and sand as far as the eyes can see.                                                        
334. But you also find camel said Ravi.                                                        
335. Heera says, Not just camels.                                                        
336. If you visit our desert, you will see snakes, lizards and many insects too.                                                        
337. Ravi wondered, why do the animals, the vegetation and the way people live vary from place to place?                                                        
338. Are they all related to each other?                                                        
339. Oh yes very much so, the teacher replied.                                                        
340. All plants, animals and human beings depend on their immediate surroundings.                                                        
341. Often they are also interdependent on each other.                                                        
342. This relation between the living organisms, as well as a relation between the organisms and their surroundings form an ecosystem.                                                        
343. There could be an ecosystem of large rainforest, grassland, desert, mountains, Lake, river, Ocean and even a small pond.                                                        
344. Do you think the park in which Ravi and his friends played formed an ecosystem?                                                        
345. Human beings interact with the environment and modify it according to their needs.                                                        
346. Early humans adapted themselves to the natural surroundings.                                                        
347. They led a simple life and fulfilled their requirements from the nature around them.                                                        
348. With time, needs grew and became more varied.                                                        
349. Humans learn new ways to use and change the environment.                                                        
350. They learn to grow crops, domesticate animals and lead a settled life.                                                        
351. The wheel was invented, surplus food was produced, barter systems emerged, trade started and commerce developed.                                                        
352. The Industrial Revolution enabled large scale production.                                                        
353. Transportation becomes faster.                                                        
354. The Information Revolution made communication easier and speedy across the world.                                                        
355. Have you ever thought about why you love eating a juicy watermelon in summer and hot roasted peanuts in winter?                                                        
356. A perfect balance is necessary between the natural and human environment.                                                        
357. Humans must learn to live and use their environment in a harmonious way.                                                        
358.  Nurie, a girl from Mizoram from Ravi's class                                                        
359. She often talks about the lush green surroundings of her place.                                                        
360. Seeing Ravi upset at having lost his playground, Nurie invited him to visit her home state during the coming vacation.                                                        
361. Ravi's Teacher asked the students to draw the landscape, houses and activities of the people and places they visit during the holidays.                                                        
362. Answer the following questions.                                                        
363. What is an ecosystem?                                                        
364. What do you mean by natural environment?                                                        
365. What are the major components of the environment?                                                        
366. Give four examples of a human made environment.                                                        
367. What is lithosphere?                                                        
368. What are two major components of the biotic environment?                                                        
369. What is the biosphere?        
370.  Inside Our Earth                
371. The earth, our homeland, is a dynamic planet.                
372. It is constantly undergoing changes inside and outside.                 
373. Have you ever wondered what lies in the interior of the earth?                
374. What is the earth made up of?                
375. Just like an onion, the earth is made up of several concentric layers with one inside another.                
376.  The uppermost layer over the earth’s surface is called the crust.                
377.  It is the thinnest of all the layers.                 
378. It is about 35 km. on the continental masses and only 5 km. on the ocean floors.                
379. The main mineral constituents of the continental mass are silica and alumina.                
380. It is thus called sial (si-silica and al- alumina).                 
381. The oceanic crust mainly consists of silica and magnesium.                
382. It is therefore called sima (si-silica and ma-magnesium).                 
383. Just beneath the crust is the mantle which extends up to a depth of 2900 km. below the crust                
384. The innermost layer is the core with a radius of about 3500 km.                
385.  It is mainly made up of nickel and iron and is called nife (ni – nickel and fe – ferrous i.e. iron).                 
386. The central core has very high temperature and pressure.                
387. The deepest mine in the world is in South Africa. It is about 4 km. deep.                 
388. In search of oil engineers have dug a hole about 6 km. deep.                
389. To reach the centre of the earth (which is not possible!) you will have to dig a hole 6000 km. deep on the ocean floor.                
390.  The crust forms only 1 per cent of the volume of the earth.                 
391. 84 per cent consists of the mantle and 15 per cent makes the core.                
392. The radius of the earth is 6371 km.                
393. ROCKS AND MINERALS                
394. The earth’s crust is made up of various types of rocks.                
395. Any natural mass of mineral matter that makes up the earth’s crust is called a rock.                
396. Rocks can be of different colour, size and texture.                
397. There are three major types of rocks: igneous rocks, sedimentary rocks and metamorphic rocks.                
398. When the molten magma cools, it becomes solid.                
399. Rocks thus formed are called igneous rocks.                
400. They are also called primary rocks.                
401. There are two types of igneous rocks: intrusive rocks and extrusive rocks.                
402. Igneous: Latin word Ignis meaning fire.                
403. Sedimentary: Latin word sedimentum meaning settle down.                
404. Metamorphic: Greek word metamorphose meaning change of form.                
405. Can you imagine lava coming out from the volcanoes?                
406. Lava is actually fiery red molten magma coming out from the interior of the earth on its surface.                 
407. When this molten lava comes on the earth’s surface, it rapidly cools down and becomes solid.                
408. Rocks formed in such a way on the crust are called extrusive igneous rocks.                 
409. They have a very fine grained structure.                
410. For example, basalt.                 
411. The Deccan plateau is made up of basalt rocks.                
412. Sometimes the molten magma cools down deep inside the earth’s crust.                 
413. Solid rocks formed are called intrusive igneous rocks.                 
414. Since they cool down slowly they form large grains.                
415. Granite is an example of such a rock.                
416. Grinding stones used to prepare paste/powder of spices and grains are made of granite.                
417. Fossils: The remains of the dead plants and animals trapped in the layers of rocks are called fossils.                
418. Rocks roll down, crack, and hit each other and are broken down into small fragments                
419. These smaller particles are called sediments.                
420. These sediments are transported and deposited by wind, water, etc.                 
421. These loose sediments are compressed and hardened to form layers of rocks.                 
422. These types of rocks are called sedimentary rocks.                 
423. For example, sandstone is made from grains of sand.                
424. These rocks may also contain fossils of plants, animals and other micro- organisms that once lived on them.                
425. Igneous and sedimentary rocks can change into metamorphic rocks under great heat and pressure                
426. For example, clay changes into slate and limestone into marble.                
427. Rocks are very useful to us.                
428. The hard rocks are used for making roads, houses and buildings.                
429. You use stones in many games.                 
430. For example, seven stones (pitthoo), hop- scotch (stapu/kit kit), five stones (gitti).                 
431. Find out some more such games by asking your grandparents, parents, neighbours, etc.                
432. Collect pictures of some monuments and find out which are the rocks used to build them.                
433. Two pictures have been collected for you.                
434. The Red Fort is made of red sandstone                
435. The Taj Mahal is made of white marble                
436. You will be surprised to know that one type of rock changes to another type under certain conditions in a cyclic manner.                 
437. This process of transformation of the rock from one to another is known as the rock cycle                
438. You have already learnt when the molten magma cools; it solidifies to become igneous rock.                 
439. These igneous rocks are broken down into small particles that are transported and deposited to form sedimentary rocks.                 
440. When the igneous and sedimentary rocks are subjected to heat and pressure they change into metamorphic rocks.                 
441. The metamorphic rocks which are still under great heat and pressure melt down to form molten magma                
442. This molten magma again can cool down and solidify into igneous rocks.                
443. What are the minerals found in your state?                
444. Collect some samples to show in your class.                
445. Rocks are made up of different minerals.                
446. Minerals are naturally occurring substances which have certain physical properties and definite chemical composition.                
447. Minerals are very important to humankind.                
448. Some are used as fuels. For example, coal, natural gas and petroleum.                 
449. They are also used in industries – iron, aluminium, gold, uranium, etc, in medicine, in fertilisers, etc.                
450. Answer the following questions.                
451. What are the three layers of the earth?                
452. What is a rock?                
453. Name three types of rocks.                
454. How are extrusive and intrusive rocks formed?
455. What do you mean by a rock cycle?
456. What are the uses of rocks?                
457. Tick the correct answer.                
458. Gold, petroleum and coal are examples of?
459. Rocks which contain fossils are?
460. The thinnest layer of the earth is?                
461. Match the following.                
462. Give reasons.                
463. We cannot go to the centre of the earth.                
464. Sedimentary rocks are formed from sediments.                
465. Limestone is changed into marble.                
466. For fun.                
467. What are the minerals most commonly used in the following objects?                
468. Identify some more objects made up of different minerals.
469. Our Changing Earth
470. Take a small coloured paper pellet and put it in a beaker half filled with water                                
471. Place the beaker on a tripod stand and heat it.                                
472. As the water warms up, you will observe that the paper pellet is moving upward along with the warm layers of water and then sinks back along with the cooler layers of water.                                
473. The molten magma inside the earth moves in a similar manner.                                
474. The lithosphere is broken into a number of plates known as the Lithospheric plates.                                
475. You will be surprised to know that these plates move around very slowly – just a few millimetres each year.                                 
476. This is because of the movement of the molten magma inside the earth.                                
477. The molten magma inside the earth moves in a circular manner as shown in the activity.                                
478. The movement of these plates causes changes on the surface of the earth.                                 
479. The earth movements are divided on the basis of the forces which cause them.                                
480. The forces which act in the interior of the earth are called Endogenic forces and the forces that work on the surface of the earth are called as Exogenic forces.                                 
481. Endogenic forces sometimes produce sudden movements and at the other times produce slow movements.                                
482. Sudden movements like earthquakes and volcanoes cause mass destruction over the surface of the earth.                                
483. Lithospheric plates.                                
484. The earth’s crust consists of several large and some small, rigid, irregularly shaped plates (slabs) which carry continents and the ocean floor.                                
485. A volcano is a vent (opening) in the earth’s crust through which molten material erupts suddenly.                                 
486. Similarly, when the Lithospheric plates move, the surface of the earth vibrates.                                
487. The vibrations can travel all round the earth.                                 
488. These vibrations are called earthquakes.                                
489. The place in the crust where the movement starts is called the focus.                                 
490. The place on the surface above the focus is called the epicentre.                                
491. Vibrations travel outwards from the epicentre as waves.
492. Greatest damage is usually closest to the epicentre and the strength of the earthquake decreases away from the centre.
493. Take a container.                                
494. Fill it with water and close it with a lid. Put the water to boil.                                
495. Now put some peas, spoon and beads on top of the lid.                                 
496. What do you notice?                                
497. As the water boils the lid begins to shake.                                
498. The things which you have put on the lid also vibrate.                                 
499.  The beads roll down and the spoon vibrates to make a sound.                                 
500. In the same manner, the earth vibrates when an earthquake occurs.                                
501. There are three types of earthquake waves.                                
502. P waves or longitudinal waves.                                
503. S waves or transverse waves .                                
504. Try to find out the properties of these waves from an encyclopedia.                                
505. L waves or surface waves.                                
506. Although earthquakes cannot be predicted, the impact can certainly be minimised if we are prepared before-hand.                                
507. Some common earthquake prediction methods adopted locally by people include studying animal behaviour; fish in the ponds get agitated, snakes come to the surface.                                
508. A massive earthquake measuring 6.9 on the Richter scale hit Bhuj Town on 26th January 2001.                                
509. Atleast 971 students and 31 teachers are feared to have lost their lives following the collapse of school buildings.                                
510. Three days after the quake, concern rose about food, blankets and medical supplies not reaching everyone.                                
511. Phone lines, water pipelines and power stations transmission lines were knocked out.                                
512. Hundreds of fires started as charcoal, cookers overturned.                                
513. The President declares a state of emergency.                                
514. The Chief Minister of Gujarat has launched an appeal for the Centre to deal with the disaster.
515. An earthquake is measured with a machine called a seismograph.                                
516. The magnitude of the earthquake is measured on the Richter scale.                                
517. An earthquake of 2.0 or less can be felt only a little.                                
518. An earthquake over 5.0 can cause damage from things falling.                                 
519. A 6.0 or higher magnitude is considered very strong and 7.0 is classified as a major earthquake.                                
520. Activity                                
521. Read the ‘Earthquake – A case study’ given in the form of headlines that appeared in the newspapers after the quake.                                 
522. Imagine if a quake suddenly shook in the middle of the school day, where would you go for safety?                                
523. Where to take shelter during an earthquake —                                
524. Safe Spot – Under a kitchen counter, table or desk, against an inside corner or wall.                                
525. Stay Away from – Fire places, areas around chimneys, windows that shatter including mirrors and picture frames.
526. Be Prepared – Spread awareness amongst your friends and family members and face any disaster confidently.                                
527. Major Land Forms.                                
528. The landscape is being continuously worn away by two processes – weathering and erosion.                                
529. Weathering is the breaking up of the rocks on the earth’s surface.                                
530. Erosion is the wearing away of the landscape by different agents like water, wind and ice.                                 
531. The eroded material is carried away or transported by water, wind, etc. and eventually deposited.                                 
532. This process of erosion and deposition creates different landforms on the surface of the earth.                                
533. There are thousands of small waterfalls in the world.                                 
534. The highest waterfall is Angel Falls of Venezuela in South America.                                
535. The other waterfalls are Niagara falls located on the border between Canada and USA in North America and Victoria Falls on the borders of Zambia and Zimbabwe in Africa.                                
536. Work of River.                                
537. The running water in the river erodes the landscape.                                
538. When the river tumbles at steep angle over very hard rocks or down a steep valley side it forms a waterfall                                 
539. As the river enters the plain it twists and turns forming large bends known as meanders.                                
540. Due to continuous erosion and deposition along the sides of the meander, the ends of the meander loop come closer and closer.                                 
541. The ends of the wither loop get closer.                                
542. In due course of time the meander loop cuts off from the river and forms a cut-off lake, also called an ox-bow lake.                                
543. At times the river overflows its banks.                                
544. This leads to the flooding of the neighbouring areas                                
545. As it floods, it deposits layers of fine soil and other material called sediments along its banks.                                
546. Such soils and materials are called sediments.                                
547. This leads to the formation of a flat fertile floodplain.                                
548. The raised banks are called levees.                                
549. As the river approaches the sea, the speed of the flowing water decreases and the river begins to break up into a number of streams called distributaries.                                
550. The river becomes so slow that it begins to deposit its load.                                
551. Each distributary forms its own mouth.                                
552. The collection of sediments from all the mouths forms a delta.                                
553. Find out the names of a few rivers of the world that form a delta.                                
554. The erosion and deposition of the sea waves gives rise to coastal landforms.                                 
555. Seawaves continuously strike at the rocks. Cracks develop.                                 
556. Over time they become larger and wider.                                 
557. They are called sea caves.                                 
558. As these cavities become bigger and bigger only the roof of the caves remain, thus forming sea arches.                                 
559. Further, erosion breaks the roof and only walls are left.                                 
560. These wall-like features are called stacks.                                
561. The steep rocky coast rising almost vertically above sea water is called sea cliff.                                
562. The sea waves deposit sediments along the shores forming beaches.                                
563. Work of Ice.                                
564. Glaciers are “rivers of ice”                                
565. “rivers of ice” which too erode the landscape by bulldozing soil and stones to expose the solid rock below.                                
566. Glaciers carve out deep hollows there.                                 
567. As the ice melts they get filled up with water and become beautiful lakes in the mountains.                                
568. The material carried by the glacier such as rocks big and small, sand and silt gets deposited.                                 
569. These deposits form glacial moraines.                                
570. Work of wind.                                
571. Have you ever visited a desert?                                 
572. Try to collect some pictures of sand dunes.                                
573. An active agent of erosion and deposition in the deserts is wind.                                
574. In deserts you can see rocks in the shape of a mushroom, commonly called mushroom rocks.                                
575. Winds erode the lower section of the rock more than the upper part.                                
576. Therefore, such rocks have narrower base and wider top.                                 
577. When the wind blows, it lifts and transports sand from one place to another.                                 
578. When it stops blowing the sand falls and gets deposited in low hill – like structures.                                
579. These are called sand dunes.                                
580. When the grains of sand are very fine and light, the wind can carry it over very long distances.                                 
581. When such sand is deposited in large areas, it is called loess.                                 
582. Large deposits of loess are found in China.                                
583. Answer the following questions.                                
584. Why do the plates move?
585. What are exogenic and endogenic forces?
586. What is erosion?
587. How are flood plains formed?
588. What are sand dunes?
589. How are beaches formed?
590. What are oxbow lakes?
591. Tick the correct answer.
592. Which is not an erosional feature of sea waves?
593. The depositional feature of a glacier is.                                
594. Which is caused by the sudden movements of the earth?
595. Mushroom rocks are found in.                                
596. Ox bow lakes are found in.
597. Carbon dioxide released in the atmosphere creates a greenhouse effect by trapping the heat radiated from the earth.                        
598. It is therefore called a greenhouse gas and without it the earth would have been too cold to live in.                        
599. And without it the earth would have been too cold to live in.
600. However, when its level in the atmosphere increases due to factory smoke or car fumes, the heat retained increases the temperature of the earth.                        
601. This is called global warming.                        
602. This rise in temperature causes the snow in coldest parts of the world to melt.                        
603. As a result the sea level rises, causing floods in the coastal areas.                        
604. There may be drastic changes in the climate of a place leading to extinction of some plants and animals in the long run.
605. Our earth is surrounded by a huge blanket of air called the atmosphere.                        
606. All living beings on this earth depend on the atmosphere for their survival.                        
607. It provides us the air we breathe and protects us from the harmful effects of the sun’s rays.                         
608. Without this blanket of protection, we would be baked alive by the heat of the sun during day and get frozen during night.                         
609. So it is this mass of air that has made the temperature on the earth liveable.                        
610. COMPOSITION OF THE ATMOSPHERE
611. Do you know that the air we take in while breathing is actually a mixture of many gases?                        
612. Nitrogen and oxygen are two gases which make up the bulk of the atmosphere.                         
613. Carbon dioxide, helium, ozone, argon and hydrogen are found in lesser quantities.                        
614. Apart from these gases, tiny dust particles are also present in the air.                        
615. Nitrogen is the most plentiful gas in the air.                         
616. When we inhale, we take some amount of nitrogen into our lungs and exhale it.                         
617. But plants need nitrogen for their survival.                        
618. They can not take nitrogen directly from the air. 
619. Bacteria, that live in the soil and roots of some plants, take nitrogen from the air and change its form so that plants can use it.                        
620. Oxygen is the second most plentiful gas in the air.
621. Humans and animals take oxygen from the air as they breathe.                        
622. Green plants produce oxygen during photosynthesis.                        
623. In this way oxygen content in the air remains constant.                        
624. If we cut trees then this balance gets disturbed.                        
625. Carbon dioxide is another important gas.                        
626. Green plants use carbon dioxide to make their food and release oxygen.                         
627. Humans or animals release carbon dioxide.                         
628. The amount of carbon dioxide released by humans or animals seems to be equal to the amount used by the plants which make a perfect balance.                        
629. However, the balance is upset by burning of fuels, such as coal and oil.                         
630. They add billions of tons of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere each year.                         
631. As a result, the increased volume of carbon dioxide is affecting the earth’s weather and climate.                        
632. When air is heated, it expands, becomes lighter and goes up.                        
633. Cold air is denser and heavy.                         
634. That is why it tends to sink down.                        
635. When hot air rises, cold air from surrounding area rushes there to fill in the gap.                        
636. That is how air circulation takes place.
637. STRUCTURE OF THE ATMOSPHERE
638. Our atmosphere is divided into five layers starting from the earth’s surface.                         
639. These are Troposphere, Stratosphere, Mesosphere, Thermosphere and Exosphere.                        
640. Troposphere: This layer is the most important layer of the atmosphere.                         
641. Its average height is 13 km.                        
642. The air we breathe exists here.
643. Almost all the weather phenomena like rainfall, fog and hailstorm occur in this layer.                        
644. Stratosphere: Above the troposphere lies the stratosphere.                         
645. It extends up to a height of 50 km.                        
646. This layer is almost free from clouds and associated weather phenomenon.                        
647. As a result, the conditions here are ideal for flying a plane.                        
648. One important feature of stratosphere is that it contains a layer of ozone gas.                        
649. We have just learnt how it protects us from the harmful effect of the sun rays.                        
650. Mesosphere: This is the third layer of the atmosphere.                        
651. It lies above the stratosphere.                        
652. It extends up to the height of 80 km.                        
653. Meteorites burn up in this layer on entering from the space.                        
654. Thermosphere: In thermosphere temperature rises very rapidly with increasing height.
655. The ionosphere is a part of this layer.                        
656. It extends between 80-400 km.                        
657. This layer helps in radio transmission.                        
658. In fact, radio waves transmitted from the earth are reflected back to the earth by this layer.                        
659. Exosphere: The upper most layer of the atmosphere is known as exosphere.                         
660. This layer has very thin air.                        
661. Light gases like helium and hydrogen float into the space from here.                        
662. Weather and Climate.                        
663. “Is it going to rain today?” “Will it be bright and sunny today?”                         
664. ”How many times have we heard this from anxious cricket fans speculating the fate of a One Day match?                        
665. If we imagine our body to be a radio and the mind its speaker, weather is something that fiddles with its control knobs.                        
666. Weather is this hour-to-hour, day to day condition of the atmosphere.                         
667. A hot or humid weather may make one irritable.                         
668. A pleasant, breezy weather may make one cheerful and even plan for an outing.                        
669. Weather can change dramatically from day to day.                        
670. However, the average weather condition of a place for a longer period of time represents the climate of a place.                        
671. Now do you understand why we have daily weather forecasts?                        
672. The temperature you feel everyday is the temperature of the atmosphere.                        
673. The degree of hotness and coldness of the air is known as temperature.                        
674. The temperature of the atmosphere changes not only between day and night but also from season to season.                        
675. Summers are hotter than winters.                        
676. An important factor that influences the distribution of temperature is insolation.
677. Insolation is the incoming solar energy intercepted by the earth.
678. The amount of insolation decreases from the equator towards the poles.                        
679. Therefore, the temperature decreases in the same manner.                         
680.  Now do you understand why poles are covered with snow?                        
681. If the earth’s temperature rises too high, it would become too warm for some crops to grow.                        
682. Temperature in cities is much higher than that of villages.                         
683. The concrete and metals in buildings and the asphalt of roads get heated up during the day.                        
684. This heat is released during the night.
685. Also, the crowded high rise buildings of the cities trap the warm air and thus raise the temperature of the cities.                        
686. Air Pressure.                        
687. You will be surprised to know that air above us presses us with a great force on our bodies.                        
688. However, we don’t even feel it.                        
689. This is because the air presses us from all directions and our body exerts a counter pressure.                        
690. Air pressure is defined as the pressure exerted by the weight of air on the earth’s surface.                        
691. As we go up the layers of atmosphere, the pressure falls rapidly.                        
692. The air pressure is highest at sea level and decreases with height.                        
693. Horizontally the distribution of air pressure is influenced by temperature of air at a given place.                         
694. In areas where temperature is high the air gets heated and rises.                        
695. This creates a low-pressure area.                         
696. Low pressure is associated with cloudy skies and wet weather.                        
697. In areas having lower temperature, the air is cold.                        
698. It is therefore heavy.                         
699. Heavy air sinks and creates a high pressure area.                        
700. High pressure is associated with clear and sunny skies.
701. The air always moves from high pressure areas to low pressure areas.                        
702. Wind.                        
703. The movement of air from high pressure areas to low pressure areas is called wind.                        
704. You can see the wind at work.                        
705. When it blows the fallen leaves on the road or uproots the trees during the storm.                        
706. Sometimes when the wind blows gently you can even see it blowing away smoke or fine dust.                        
707. At times the wind can be so strong that it is difficult to walk against it.                        
708. You must have experienced it is not easy to hold an umbrella on a windy day.                        
709. Think of some other examples when strong winds have created problems for you.                        
710. Winds can be broadly divided into three types.                        
711. The standard unit of measuring temperature is degree Celsius.                        
712. It was invented by Anders Celsius.                        
713. On the Celsius scale the water freezes at 0°C and boils at 100°C.                        
714. Do you know that on the moon there is no air and hence no air pressure.                        
715. Astronauts have to wear special protective space suits filled with air when they go to the moon.                         
716. If they did not wear these space suits, the counter pressure exerted by the body of the astronauts would make the blood vessels burst.                         
717. The astronauts would bleed.                        
718. A wind is named after the direction from which it blows.                        
719. For example - the wind blowing from the west is called westerly.                        
720. Permanent winds – The trade winds, westerlies and easterlies are the permanent winds.                        
721. These blow constantly throughout the year in a particular direction.                        
722. Seasonal winds – These winds change their direction in different seasons.                         
723. For example monsoons in India.                        
724. Local winds – These blow only during a particular period of the day or year in a small area.                         
725. For example, land and sea breeze. Do you recall the hot and dry local wind of northern plains of India?                        
726. It is called loo.                        
727. Cyclone – Nature's fury.                        
728. Odisha, located on the eastern seacoast of India is prone to cyclones that originate in the Bay of Bengal.                         
729. On 17-18 October 1999, cyclone hit five districts of the state.                         
730. Another super cyclone occurred on 29 October 1999, that devastated large portions of the state.                        
731. The damages caused were mainly due to three factors: wind velocity, rain and tidal surge.                        
732. The winds of upto 260 km. per hour lasted for over 36 hours.                        
733. These high velocity winds uprooted trees and damaged the kutcha houses                        
734. Rooftops of several industrial sheds and other houses were also blown away.                        
735. Power supply and telecom lines snapped completely.                        
736. Heavy rain occurred under the influence of the cyclone for three days continuously.                         
737. These rains led to flooding in the major rivers of Odisha.                        
738. The cyclonic winds caused tidal waves that swept 20 km. inland and brought massive destruction to the coastal areas.                        
739. The 7 to 10 m high tidal wave intruded suddenly and caused massive damage to the standing paddy crops.                        
740. The cyclone originated as a “depression” in the Gulf of Thailand, near east of Port Blair, on 25 October 1999 and gradually moved in a northwestward direction.                        
741. It intensified into a super cyclone and hit the area between Erasama and Balikuda in Odisha on 29 October at 10.30 a.m.                        
742. The supercyclone swept the entire coast of Odisha including the cities of Bhubaneswar and Cuttack and 28 coastal towns.                         
743. About 13 million people were affected.                        
744. A large number of livestock were killed.                        
745. Standing crops of paddy, vegetables and fruits were heavily damaged.                        
746. Due to salinisation caused by tidal surge, large tracts of agricultural land have turned infertile.                         
747. Large tracts of sal, teak and bamboo plantations have disappeared.                         
748. The mangrove forests between Paradeep and Konark vanished.                        
749. Moisture.                        
750. When water evaporates from land and different water bodies, it becomes water vapour.                        
751. Moisture in the air at any time, is known as humidity.                        
752. When the air is full of water vapour we call it a humid day.                        
753. As the air gets warmer, its capacity to hold the water vapour increases and so it becomes more and more humid.                        
754. On a humid day, clothes take longer to dry and sweat from our body does not evaporate easily, making us feel very uncomfortable.
755. When the water vapour rises, it starts cooling.
756. The water vapour condenses causing formation of droplets of water.                        
757. Clouds are just masses of such water droplets.                        
758. When these droplets of water become too heavy to float in air, then they come down as precipitation.
759. Jet planes flying in the sky leave a white trail behind them.                         
760. The moisture from their engines condenses.                         
761. We see trails of this condensed moisture for some time when there is no air movement to disturb it.
762. Precipitation that comes down to the earth in liquid form is called rain.                        
763. Most of the groundwater comes from rainwater.                        
764. Plants help preserve water.                        
765. When trees on hill sides are cut, rainwater flows down the bare mountains and can cause flooding of low lying areas.                        
766. On the basis of mechanism, there are three types of rainfall: the convectional rainfall, the orographic rainfall and the cyclonic rainfall.                         
767. Rainfall is very important for the survival of plants and animals.                        
768. It brings fresh water to the earth’s surface.                        
769. If rainfall is less – water scarcity and drought occur.                        
770. On the other hand if it is more, floods take place.                        
771. Other forms of precipitation are snow, sleet, hail.                        
772. Answer the following questions.                        
773. What is the atmosphere?
774. Which two gases make the bulk of the atmosphere?                        
775. Which gas creates a greenhouse effect in the atmosphere?                        
776. What is the weather?
777. Name three types of rainfall?
778. What is air pressure?
779. When you think of water, what images come to your mind?
780. You think of rivers, the waterfalls, the pitter patter of raindrops, water in your taps.
781. Children love to float paper boats in rain puddles.
782.  By noon the puddles vanish.
783. Where does the water go?
784. The sun’s heat causes evaporation of water into vapour.
785. When the water vapour cools down, it condenses and forms clouds.
786. From there it may fall on the land or sea in the form of rain, snow or sleet.
787. The process by which water continually changes its form .
788. and circulates between oceans, atmosphere and land.
789. Our earth is like a terrarium.
790. The same water that existed centuries ago still exists today.
791. The water used to irrigate a field in Haryana may have flowed down the Amazon River a hundred years ago.
792. The major sources of freshwater are the rivers, ponds, springs and glaciers.
793. The ocean bodies and the seas contain salty water.
794. The water of the oceans is salty or saline as it contains large amounts of dissolved salts.
795. Fill one-fourth of a big jar with soil and press it well.
796. Put a thin layer of humus on top of it.
797. Plant the largest plants first and then arrange the smaller ones around them.
798. Spray the arrangement with water and close the jar.
799. The water that evaporates from the leaves and soil condenses and falls back in the form of drops of water.
800. We all know that three-fourth of the earth's surface is covered by water.
801. If there is more water than land on this earth, why do so many countries face water scarcity?
802. Is all the water on earth available to us?
803. The following table gives the distribution of water in percentage.
804. Water distribution can be demonstrated by a simple activity.
805. Salinity is the amount of salt in grams present in 1000 grams of water.
806. The average salinity of oceans is 35 parts per thousand.
807. The Dead Sea in Israel has a salinity of 340 grams per litre of water.
808. Swimmers can float in it because the increased salt content makes it dense.
809. Take 2 litres of water. 
810. Let it represent the total water of the surface of the earth.
811. Measure out 12 spoons of water from this vessel into another bowl.
812. The water that is left behind in the vessel represents the salty water found in oceans and seas.
813. The water is obviously not fit for consuming.
814. It is saline.
815. The 12 spoons of water that was taken in a bowl is the total amount of freshwater on earth.
816. The figure shows us the distribution of this freshwater.
817. See for yourself how much water can actually be used by you.
818. Water is absolutely essential for survival.
819. Water alone can quench our thirst when we are thirsty.
820. Now don't you think we are wasting a precious resource when we use water carelessly?
821. There is something magical about walking barefoot on the seashore.
822. The wet sand on the beach, the cool breeze, the sea birds, the smell of salt in the air and music of waves everything is so fascinating.
823. Unlike the calm waters of ponds and lakes, ocean water keeps moving continuously.
824. It is never still.
825. The movements that occur in Oceans can be broadly categorised as waves, Tides and currents.
826. March 22 is celebrated as World Water Day 
827. when the need to conserve water is reinforced in different ways
828. when you are playing throw ball on a beach and a ball falls in water what happens?
829. It is fun to watch how the ball gets washed back to the Shore by the Waves.
830. When the water on the surface of an ocean Rises and Falls alternately they are called waves.
831. Waves are formed when wind scrapes across the ocean surface.
832. The stronger the wind blows the bigger the wave becomes.
833. Tsunami is a Japanese word that means Harbour waves as the harbours get destroyed whenever there is a tsunami.
834. Tsunami or the harbour waves truck havoc in the Indian Ocean on the 26 December 2004.
835. The wave was the result of an earthquake that had its epicentre close to The Western boundary of Sumatra.
836. The magnitude of the earthquake was 9.0 on the Richter scale.
837. As the Indian plate went under the Burma plate there was a sudden movement of the sea floor causing the earthquake.
838. The ocean floor was displaced by about 10-20 metres and tilted in a downwardly direction.
839. A huge mass of ocean water flowed to fill in the gaps that were being created by the displacement.
840. This marked the withdrawal of a water mass from the coast lines of the land masses in the south and Southeast Asia.
841. After thrusting of the Indian Plate below the Burma plate, the water mass rushed back towards the coastline.
842. Tsunami travelled at the speed of about 800 km per hour comparable to the speed of a commercial aircraft and completely washed away some of the islands in the Indian Ocean.
843. The Indira Point of Andaman and Nicobar Islands that marked the southernmost point of India got completely submerged.
844. As the wave moved from the earthquake epicentre from Sumatra towards the Andaman Islands and Sri Lanka the wavelength decreases with decreasing depth of water.
845. The travel speed also declined from 700-900 km per hour to less than 70 km per hour.
846. Tsunami waves travel up to a depth of 3 km from the coast killing more than 10,000 people and affected more than lakh of houses.
847. In India the worst affected were the coastal areas of Andhra Pradesh Tamil Nadu Kerala puduCherry and the Andaman and Nicobar Islands.
848. While the earthquake cannot be predicted in advance it is possible to give 3 hour notice of a potential Tsunami.
849. Such early warning systems are in place across the Pacific Ocean but not in the Indian ocean.
850. Tsunamis are rare in the Indian ocean as the seismic activity is less as compared to the Pacific.
851. The tsunami that ravaged the south and Southeast Asia coasts in December 2004 is the most devastating Tsunami in the last several hundred years.
852. The large damage caused to life and the property was primarily a result of lack of monitoring the early warning system and knowledge among the coast dwellers as of the Indian Ocean.
853. The first indication that Tsunami is approaching is a rapid withdrawal of water from the coastal region followed by the destructive wave.
854. When this happened on the coast instead of people going to high ground they started assembling at the coast to view the Miracle.
855. As a consequence, there was a large casualty of curious onlookers when the gigantic Waves Tsunami struck.
856. The rhythmic rise and fall of ocean water twice in a day is called tide.
857. It is high tide when water covers much of the Shore by rising to its highest level.
858. It is low tide then water falls to its lowest level and recedes from the shore.
859. The strong gravitational pull exerted by the sun and the moon on the earth's surface causes the Tides.
860. The water of earth closer to the moon gets put under the influence of the Moon's gravitational force causing high tide.
861. During the full moon and new moon days, the sun, the moon and the earth are in the same line and the Tides are highest.
862. These Tides are called spring tides.
863. But when the moon is in its first and last quarter the ocean waters get drawn in diagonally opposite directions by the gravitational pull of the sun and moon resulting in low tide.
864. These are called neap tides.
865. High Tides help in navigation.
866. They raise the water level close to the shores.
867. This helps the ships to arrive at the harbour more easily.
868. The high tides also help in fishing.
869. Many more fish come closer to the shore during the high tide.
870. This enables fishermen to get plentifull catches.
871. The rise and the fall water due to Tides is being used to generate electricity in some places.
872. Fill 3-4 of the buckets with tap water.
873. Heat the water by putting an immersion rod on one side of the bucket.
874. On the other side, introduce an ice tray just removed from a freezer.
875. Add a drop of red ink to observe the path of current by the process of convection
876. Ocean currents are streams of water flowing constantly on an ocean surface in definite directions.
877. The ocean currents may be warm or cold.
878. Generally the warm ocean currents originate near the equator move towards the poles.
879. The cold currents carry water from polar or higher latitudes to tropical or lower latitudes.
880. The Labrador ocean current is cold current while the gulf stream is a warm current.
881. The ocean current influences the temperature conditions of an area.
882. Warm currents bring about warm temperatures over land surface.
883. The areas where the warm and cold currents meet provide the best fishing Grounds of the world.
884. Seas around Japan and Eastern Coast of North America are such examples.
885. The areas where a warm and cold currents meet also experience foggy weather 
886. making it difficult for navigation.
887. answer the following question.
888. What is precipitation?
889. What is the water cycle?
890. What are the factors affecting the height of waves?
891. What factors affect the movement of ocean water?
892. What are Tides and how are they caused?
893. What are ocean currents?
894. Give reasons.
895. Ocean water is salty.
896. The quality of water is deteriorating.
897. Salima was very excited about her summer camp.
898. She went to see Manali in Himachal Pradesh with her classmates.
899. All she remembered was how amazed she was to see the changing forms of the topography and natural vegetation as the bus went uphill.
900. The dense forests of Sal and Teak in Giripad gradually disappeared and tall trees with slender pointed leaves and conical canopy appeared on the slopes of the mountain.
901. He learned that they were coniferous trees.
902. His attention was drawn to the red-red flowers blooming on tall trees.
903. They were rhododendron flowers.
904. On his way from Manali to the Rohtang Pass, he noticed that the land was covered with small grass and snow at some places.
905. From Salima's observation, we can infer that the height and vegetation characteristics of the site are related to each other.
906. Climate changes with the change in altitude and due to this the natural vegetation also changes.
907. The growth of vegetation depends on temperature and moisture.
908. Apart from this, it also depends on factors like slope and thickness of soil layer.
909. Due to the difference in these components, the density and type of natural vegetation of a place also changes.
910. Natural vegetation is generally classified into the following three main categories:
911. (a) Forests: Which grow in areas with suitable temperature and full rainfall for trees.
912. On the basis of these factors, dense and open forests develop.
913. (b) Grasslands: Which grow in the area with moderate rainfall.
914. (c) Prickly shrubs: Prickly shrubs and shrubs are born in dry areas.
915. Salima was narrating this experience of her journey to the Himalayas to her father.
916. His father had gone to different places of the world. He told Salima about the different types of vegetation found in different parts of different continents.
917. He gave many other information about coniferous forests in the subpolar regions, thorny bushes in the deserts, dense tropical hardwood forests in the wetlands.
918. Salima understood that almost all types of vegetation are found in the Himalayan regions, which are found on moving from the equator to the pole.
919. The main reason for the change in the type of natural vegetation is the change of climate.
920. Let us get information about the different types of natural flora of the world, their properties and the wild animals living there.
921. Forests Tropical evergreen forests These forests are also called tropical rain forests .
922. These dense forests are found near the equator and the tropics.
923. These regions are hot and receive heavy rainfall throughout the year.
924. Since the weather here is never dry, the leaves of the trees here do not shed completely.
925. That's why they are called evergreens.
926. Due to the thick canopy of very dense trees, even during the day, sunlight does not reach inside the forest.
927. Generally hardwood trees like rosewood, ebony, mahogany etc. are found here.
928. Tropical deciduous forests are monsoon forests found in large parts of India, northern Australia and Central America .
929. There are seasonal changes in these areas.
930. To conserve water, the trees here shed their leaves in the dry season.
931. The hardwood trees found in these forests are Sal, Teak, Neem and Shisham.
932. Hardwood trees are very useful for making furniture, transport and building materials.
933. Commonly found animals in these regions are tigers, lions, elephants, golden langurs and monkeys .
934. Temperate evergreen forests are located in mid-latitude coastal regions .
935. They are commonly found on the eastern sides of continents such as southeast America, south China and southeast Brazil.
936. Both hard and soft trees like oak, pine and eucalyptus are found here.
937. Temperate deciduous forests progressing towards higher latitudes yield more temperate deciduous forests.
938. They are found in the coastal regions of North-East America, China, New Zealand, Chile and Western Europe. They shed their leaves in dry weather.
939. The trees found here are oak, ash, beech, etc.
940. Deer, foxes, and wolves are common animals here.
941. And birds like Monal are also found here.
942. You have learned that most of the eastern and north-eastern sides of the continents are covered with temperate evergreen and deciduous trees.
943. The western and south-western sides of the continents are different.
944. Mediterranean flora is found here.
945. It is mostly found in the regions near the Mediterranean Sea of ​​Europe, Africa and Asia.
946. Hence it got its name.
947. These plants are also found in the outer regions of the Mediterranean such as California, South-West Africa, South-Western South America and South-West Australia in the United States.
948. These regions have hot-dry summers and mild winters with rainfall.
949. The fruits of the grape genus (Citrus) such as oranges, figs, olives and grapes are usually grown in these areas, because people have removed the natural vegetation here to do agriculture, according to their wish.
950. There is little wildlife here.
951. Coniferous forests are also called 'taiga'. These forests are also found at higher altitudes.
952. Salima had seen these trees in abundance in the Himalayas.
953. These are tall, soft woody evergreen trees. The wood of these trees is used to make pulp, which is used to make general and newsprint.
954. Soft wood is also used for making matches and boxes for packing.
955. Pine, deodar etc. are the main trees of these forests.
956. Animals like silver foxes, mink, polar bears are commonly found here.
957. Tropical grasslands: These forests grow on either side of the equator and extend from both sides of the equator to the tropical regions .
958. Here vegetation grows in areas with low to moderate rainfall.
959. This grass can grow very tall, about 3 to 4 metres in height.
960. The savanna grassland of Africa is of this type.
961. Animals like elephant, zebra, giraffe, deer, leopard etc. are commonly found in tropical grasslands .
962. The grass here is generally short and nutritious.
963. Wild buffalo, bison, antelope are commonly found in temperate regions.
964. Leafy shrubs: Found in dry desert-like regions.
965. Tropical deserts are found on the western sides of continents.
966. Due to intense heat and very little rainfall, there is a lack of vegetation here.
967. Concern the desert region on the map of the world.
968. Can you name the largest desert of India?
969. Name some animals of the desert, which you have come to know earlier.
970. If you go to the polar region, you will find that place very cold.
971. Very limited natural vegetation is found here.
972. Only mosses, lichens and small shrubs are found here.
973. It develops during the short-lived summer season.
974. It is called tundra type of vegetation.
975. These plants are found in the polar regions of Europe, Asia and North America.
976. The animals here have thick plumage and thick skin on their body, which keeps them safe in cold climates.
977. Some of the animals found here are seal, walrus, musk-ox, polar owl, polar bear and snow fox .
978. Salima's father showed her pictures of some dense forests.
979. In some of the pictures, Salima saw people clearing the forests by cutting down trees.
980. His father told that the local people wanted a place for agriculture and housing.
981. So he cleared the forests.
982. Salima started thinking that if the forests are cleared, then where will the wildlife go?
983. Will these forests be able to become like that again?
984. If people keep cutting trees like this, then in future there will be enough oxygen, water vapour, wood, fruits, nuts etc.?
985. Do you agree with Salima?
986. Discuss with your polar bear friends the decline in the diversity of flora and fauna.
987. Give some suggestions about their conservation.
988. Renuka was excited.
989. Shrikant Uncle was home after a gap of nearly four months.
990. He was a wildlife photographer and travelled widely.
991.  Renuka’s interest in wildlife and forests began at an early age, when her uncle introduced her to books on nature.
992. Pictures of distant lands and people, who lived there, always fascinated her.
993. In these pictures Renuka, you can see people from different parts of the world .
994. some from dry deserts, some from frozen lands and some from hot wet rainforests.
995. They look so different from me.
996. Observed Renuka.
997. They may look different, but they share the same basic needs of life – food, clothing and shelter”, 
998. Explained Shrikant Uncle.
999. Their children do the same things as you probably do,play games, quarrel sometimes and then make-up, sing,dance and help the families with various things that need to be done.
1000. They live closer to nature and very early in their lives have learnt to care for nature.
1001. They learn how to catch fish and how to collect material from the forests.
1002. Before learning about the Amazon basin, let us look at the map
1003. Notice that the tropical region lies very close to the equator
1004. between 10°N and 10°S. So, it is referred to as the equatorial region.
1005. The river Amazon flows through this region.
1006. Notice how it flows from the mountains to the west and reaches the Atlantic Ocean to the east.
1007. The place where a river flows into another body of water is called the river’s mouth.
1008. Numerous tributaries join the Amazon River to form the Amazon basin.
1009. The river basin drains portions of Brazil, parts of Peru, Bolivia, Ecuador, Columbia and a small part of Venezuela.
1010. Name the countries of the basin through which the equator passes.
1011. As you now know, the Amazon Basin stretches directly on the equator and is characterised by hot and wet climate throughout the year.
1012. Both day and night are almost equally hot and humid. The skin feels sticky.
1013. It rains almost everyday, that too without much warning.
1014. The day temperatures are high with very high humidity.
1015. At night the temperature goes down but the humidity remains high.
1016. As it rains heavily in this region, thick forests grow
1017. The forests are in fact so thick that the dense “roof” created by leaves and branches does not allow the sunlight to reach the ground.
1018. The ground remains dark and damp.
1019. Only shade tolerant vegetation may grow here.
1020. Orchids, bromeliads grow as plant parasites.
1021. The rainforest is rich in fauna.
1022. Birds such as toucans, hummingbirds, macaw with their brilliantly coloured plumage, oversized bills for eating make them different from birds we commonly see in India.
1023. Animals like monkeys,sloth and ant-eating tapirs are found here
1024. Various species of reptiles and snakes also thrive in these jungles.
1025. Crocodiles, snakes, and pythons abound. Anaconda and boa constrictor are some of the species.
1026. Besides, the basin is home to thousands of species of insects.
1027. Several species of fishes including the flesh-eating Piranha fish are also found in the river.
1028. This basin is thus extraordinarily rich in the variety of life found there.
1029. People grow most of their food in small areas after clearing some trees in the forest.
1030. While men hunt and fish along the rivers, women take care of the crops. 
1031. They mainly grow tapioca, pineapple and sweet potato
1032. As hunting and fishing are uncertain it is the women who keep their families alive by feeding them the vegetables they grow.
1033. They practice slash and burn agriculture”
1034. The staple food is manioc, also known as cassava that grows under the ground like the potato.
1035. They also eat queen ants and egg sacs.
1036. Cash crops like coffee, maize and cocoa are also grown.
1037. The rainforests provide a lot of wood for the houses.
1038. Some families live in thatched houses shaped like beehives.
1039. There are other large apartment-like houses called “Maloca” with a steeply slanting roof.
1040. Life of the people of the Amazon basin is slowly changing.
1041. In the older days the heart of the forest could be reached only by navigating the river.
1042. In 1970 the Trans Amazon highway made all parts of the rainforest accessible.
1043. Aircrafts and helicopters are also used for reaching various places.
1044. The indigenous population was pushed out from the area and forced to settle in new areas where they continued to practice their distinctive way of farming.
1045. The developmental activities are leading to the gradual destruction of the biologically diverse rainforests.
1046. It is estimated that a large area of the rainforest has been disappearing annually in the Amazon basin.
1047. You can see that this destruction of forests has a much wider implication
1048. The topsoil is washed away as the rains fall and the lush forest turns into a barren landscape.
1049. The tributaries of rivers Ganga and Brahmaputra together form the Ganga-Brahmaputra basin in the Indian subcontinent.
1050. The basin lies in the sub-tropical region that is situated between 10°N to 30°N latitudes.
1051. The tributaries of the River Ganga like the Ghaghra, the Son, the Chambal, the Gandak, the Kosi and the tributaries of Brahmaputra drain it.
1052. Look at the atlas and find names of some tributaries of the River Brahmaputra.
1053. The plains of the Ganga and the Brahmaputra, the mountains and the foothills of the Himalayas and the Sundarbans delta are the main features of this basin.
1054. Ox-bow lakes dot the plain area.
1055.  The area is dominated by monsoon climate.
1056. The monsoon brings rains from mid-June to mid-September.
1057. The summers are hot and the winters cool.
1058. Look at the map of India
1059. Find out the states in which the Ganga-Brahmaputra basin lies.
1060. The basin area has varied topography.
1061. The environment plays a dominant role in the distribution of the population.
1062. The mountain areas with steep slopes have inhospitable terrain. Therefore less number of people live in the mountain area of the Ganga- Brahmaputra basin.
1063. The plain area provides the most suitable land for human habitation.
1064. The soil is fertile.
1065. Agriculture is the main occupation of the people where flat land is available to grow crops
1066. The main crop is paddy
1067. Since cultivation of paddy requires sufficient water, it is grown in the areas where the amount of rainfall is high.
1068. Wheat, maize, sorghum, gram and millets are the other crops that are grown.
1069. Cash crops like sugarcane and jute are also grown.
1070. Banana plantations are seen in some areas of the plain.
1071. In West Bengal and Assam tea is grown in plantations
1072. Silk is produced through the cultivation of silk worms in parts of Bihar and Assam.
1073. In the mountains and hills, where the slopes are gentle, crops are grown on terraces.
1074. The vegetation cover of the area varies according to the type of landforms
1075. In the Ganga and Brahmaputra plain tropical deciduous trees grow, along with teak, sal and peepal.
1076. Thick bamboo groves are common in the Brahmaputra plain.
1077. The delta area is covered with the mangrove forest.
1078. In parts of Uttarakhand, Sikkim and Arunachal Pradesh, coniferous trees like pine, deodar and fir can be seen because the climate is cool and the slopes are steep.
1079. There is a variety of wildlife in the basin
1080. Elephants, tigers, deer and monkeys are common
1081. The one-horned rhinoceros is found in the Brahmaputra plain
1082.  In the delta area, Bengal tiger and crocodiles are found.
1083. Aquatic life abounds in the fresh river waters, the lakes and the Bay of Bengal Sea.
1084. The most popular varieties of the fish are the rohu, catla and hilsa.
1085. Fish and rice is the staple diet of the people living in the area.
1086. Binod is a fisherman living in the Matwali Maun village of Bihar.
1087. He is a happy man today
1088. With the efforts of the fellow fishermen – Ravindar, Kishore, Rajiv and others, he cleaned the maun or the ox-bow lake to cultivate different varieties of fish.
1089. The local weed (vallisneria, hydrilla) that grows in the lake is the food of the fish.
1090. The land around the lake is fertile
1091. He sows crops such as paddy, maize and pulses in these fields.
1092. The buffalo is used to plough the land.
1093. The community is satisfied.
1094. There is enough fish caught from the river – enough fish to eat and enough fish to sell in the market.They have even begun supply to the neighbouring town.
1095. The communities living in harmony with nature.
1096. As long as the pollutants from nearby towns do not find their way into the lake waters, the fish cultivation will not face any threat.
1097. The Ganga-Brahmaputra plain has several big towns and cities.
1098. The cities of Allahabad, Kanpur, Varanasi, Lucknow, Patna and Kolkata all with the population of more than ten lakhs are located along the River Ganga
1099. The wastewater from these towns and industries is discharged into the rivers.
1100. All the four ways of transport are well developed in the Ganga-Brahmaputra basin.
1101. In the plain areas the roadways and railways transport the people from one place to another.
1102. The waterways, is an effective means of transport particularly along the rivers
1103. Kolkata is an important port on the River Hooghly.
1104. The plain area also has a large number of airports
1105. Tourism is another important activity of the basin
1106. Taj Mahal on the banks of River Yamuna in Agra, Allahabad on the confluence of the Rivers Ganga andYamuna, Buddhists stupas in UttarPradesh and Bihar, Lucknow with its Imambara, Assam with Kaziranga and Manas with wildlife sanctuaries and Arunachal Pradesh with a distinct tribal culture are some of the places worth a visit
1107. Name the continent in which the Amazon Basin is located.
1108. What are the crops grown by the people of the Amazon Basin?
1109. Name the birds that you are likely to find in the rainforests of the Amazon.
1110. What are the major cities located on the River Ganga?
1111. Where are the one-horned rhinoceros found?
1112. What are Toucans ?
1113. Manioc is the staple food of?
1114. Kolkata is located on the river?
1115. Deodars and firs are a type of?
1116. Bengal tiger is found in?
1117. The rainforests are depleting.
1118. Paddy is grown in the Ganga-Brahmaputra plains.
1119. On an outline map of the Indian Subcontinent, draw the rivers Ganga and Brahmaputra from the source to the mouth.
1120. Also show the important tributaries of both the rivers.
1121. On the political map of South America, draw the equator
1122. Mark the countries through which the equator passes
1123. You can divide the class in different groups to show attractions based on mountain landscapes, coastal beaches, wildlife sanctuaries and places of historical importance.
1124. Collect under mentioned material.
1125. observe how destruction of trees affects the soil cover.
1126.  Three small flower pots or food cans.
1127. one big can with holes punched in the bottom.
1128. twelve coins or bottle caps.
1129. Take three small cans or pots.
1130. Fill them with soil till the top.
1131. Press the soil to make it level with the top of the can.
1132. Now put four coins or bottle caps on the soil of each can.
1133. Take the big can that has been punched with holes and fill it with water.
1134. You can also take the sprinkling can from your garden
1135. Now, sprinkle water on the three cans.
1136. On the first can sprinkle water very slowly so that no soil splashes out.
1137. Let moderate amount of water be sprinkled on the second can.
1138. On the third can, sprinkle the water heavily.
1139. You will observe that unprotected soil splashes out.
1140. Where the ‘rain’ is heavy the amount of soil that splashes out is the maximum and least in case of the first can.
1141. The coins or caps represent the tree covers.
1142. It is clear that if the land is cleared completely of the vegetation, the soil cover will quickly disappear.
1143. Mona and Raju were helping Amma to clean their house.
1144. Look at all these things, clothes, utensils, grains, combs, bottles of honey, books, every one of them is useful, said Mona.
1145. That's why they are important, Amma said.
1146. These are resources.
1147. What is a resource?
1148. Raju asked a question to Amma.
1149. Amma explained, everything that can be used to satisfy needs is a resource.
1150. Look around you and observe, you will be able to identify different types of resources.
1151. The water you drink when you are thirsty, the electricity you use in your home, the rickshaw you use to get home from school, the textbook you use for studies, all these are resources.
1152. Your father has prepared breakfast for you.
1153. The fresh vegetables they have used are also a resource.
1154. What do water, electricity, rickshaw, vegetables and textbooks all have in common?
1155. All of those items have been used by you.
1156. That's why they are useful.
1157. The utility or applicability of an object or substance makes it a resource.
1158. Raju now wanted to know that, how does any object become a resource?
1159. Amma told the children that things become resources when they have some value.
1160. Its use or utility gives it value.
1161. All resources are valuable.
1162. Amma said.
1163. Value means importance.
1164. Some resources have economic value while some resources do not have economic value.
1165. For example metals have economic value but a picturesque landscape has no economic value.
1166. But both these resources are important and fulfil the needs of human beings.
1167. Some resources can become economically valuable over time.
1168. Your grandmother's home remedies have no commercial value today.
1169. But if they are sold by a medical firm after being patented, they can be financially valuable.
1170. Time and technology are two important factors that can convert materials into resources.
1171. Both are related to the needs of the people.
1172. People themselves are the most important resource.
1173. It is people's ideas, knowledge, inventions and discoveries that create more resources.
1174. Every discovery or invention leads to many other discoveries and inventions.
1175. The discovery of fire led to the development of cooking methods and other processes, while the invention of the wheel eventually led to the development of the latest modes of transport.
1176. The technology to generate hydroelectricity has made energy from fast flowing water an important resource.
1177. Resources are generally classified into natural, man-made and human.
1178. The resources which are obtained from nature and are used without much modification are called natural resources.
1179. The air we breathe, the water from our rivers and lakes, soil and minerals are all natural resources.
1180. Many of these resources are free gifts from nature and can be put to direct use.
1181. In some circumstances, tools and technology may be needed to make the best use of a natural resource.
1182. Natural resources can be broadly divided into renewable and non-renewable resources.
1183. Renewable resources are those resources which are quickly renewed or replenished.
1184. Some of these are unlimited and are not affected by human activities, such as solar and wind power.
1185. However, careless use of some renewable resources, such as water, soil and forests, can affect their reserves.
1186. Water appears to be an infinitely renewable resource.
1187. Yet water scarcity and drying up of natural water sources is a major problem in many parts of the world today.
1188. Non-renewable resources are those resources whose reserves are limited.
1189. Once the reserves are exhausted, it can take thousands of years for them to be renewed or replenished.
1190. This period is much longer than the duration of human life, such resources are called non-renewable.
1191. Coal, petroleum and natural gas are some examples.
1192. The distribution of natural resources depends on many physical factors like terrain, climate, altitude.
1193. Due to the variation in these factors on the earth, the distribution of resources is unequal.
1194. Sometimes natural substances become resources when their original form is changed.
1195. Iron-ore was not a resource until people learned to make iron from it.
1196. People use natural resources to build bridges, roads, machines and vehicles which are known as man-made resources.
1197. Technology is also a man-made resource.
1198. That's why people like us create man-made resources by using natural resources, explains Mona.
1199. Yes, Raju nodded his head in approval.
1200. People can make the best use of nature to create more resources only when they have the knowledge, skills and technology to do so.
1201. Therefore man is a special kind of resource.
1202. Hence, people are human resources.
1203. Education and health help make people valuable resources.
1204. Improving the skills of people to be able to create more resources is called human resource development.
1205. Mona had a bad dream.
1206. He saw that all the water on the earth had dried up and all the trees had been cut down.
1207. There was neither shade nor anything to eat or drink.
1208. People were getting disturbed and wandering around in despair in search of food and shade.
1209. He told his mother about the dream.
1210. He asked, Amma, can this really happen?
1211. Yes, replied Amma. If we are not careful about renewable resources then they can become very scarce and non-renewable resources can definitely get exhausted.
1212. Raju asked, what can we do for this?
1213. A lot, replied Amma, why don't you talk to your friends?
1214. Using resources consciously and giving them time for renewal is called resource conservation.
1215. Sustainable development is a balance between the need to use resources and their conservation for the future.
1216. There are many ways to conserve resources.
1217. Everyone can contribute by reducing consumption by recycling and reusing goods.
1218. Ultimately this creates a difference because all life is related to each other.
1219. That evening the children and their friends made envelopes and shopping bags out of old newspapers, waste clothes and bamboo sticks.
1220. We'll give some of these items to families we know, Mona said.
1221. Mustafa said, it is a very good act to save our resources and keep our earth alive.
1222. Jesse said, I will be very careful not to waste the paper.
1223. He explained, many trees are cut down to make paper.
1224. I will take care that electricity is not wasted in my house, said Mustafa out loud, electricity comes from water and coal.
1225. I assure that the water in the house will not be wasted.
1226. Every drop of water is valuable, said Asha.
1227. The children said that all of us together can make a difference.
1228. These are some of the works done by Mona, Raju and their friends.
1229. What's your view?
1230. How are you going to help with resource conservation?
1231. The future of our earth and the people living on it is related to the protection and preservation of plants and ecosystems.
1232. Now it becomes our duty to ensure that.
1233. The uses of all renewable resources are sustainable.
1234. To preserve the diversity of life on earth.
1235. The damage to the natural environmental system should be minimized.
1236. Answer the following questions.
1237. Why are resources unevenly distributed on Earth?
1238. What is resource conservation?
1239. Why are human resources important?
1240. What is Sustainable Development?
1241. Mark the correct answer.
1242. Which of the following does not determine the resource?
1243. Which of the following is a man made resource?
1244. are non-renewable resources.
1245. These lines were written by the poet Abdur Rahim Khankhana, one of the nine gems of Akbar's court.
1246. What kind of resource is the poet referring to?
1247. What happens when this resource is exhausted?
1248. Imagine that you lived on a high windy plateau in prehistoric times.
1249. How will you and your friends use the strong winds?
1250. Can you call wind a resource?
1251. Now imagine that you are living in the same place in the year 2138.
1252. Can you make any use of the winds?
1253. Can you explain why wind is an important resource now?
1254. Take a stone, a leaf, a cardboard and a twig.
1255. Think about how you can use them as a resource?
1256. In a small village in Tanzania Africa, Mamba wakes up early in the morning to fetch water.
1257. She has to travel a long distance and she returns after a few hours.
1258. She then joins her mother in the household chores and helps her brothers look after the goats.
1259. His entire family owns a section of rocky land around their small hut.
1260. Mamba's father can only grow some corn and beans after hard work.
1261. Yet it is not enough to feed his family for the whole year.
1262. Peter lives in the central part of New Zealand's sheep farming region where his family runs a wool processing factory.
1263. Every day when Peter returns from school, he sees his uncle taking care of his sheep.
1264. His shed is situated some distance away on a wide meadow bordered by hills.
1265. There it is managed in a scientific method using the latest technology.
1266. Peter's family also grows vegetables through organic farming.
1267. Mamba and Peter live in two different places in the world and their lives differ greatly.
1268. This variation is due to the variation in the quality of land, soil, water, natural vegetation, animals and use of technology.
1269. The main reason why these places differ from each other is the availability of such resources.
1270. All important natural resources include land.
1271. About 30 percent of the total surface area is land.
1272. Not only this, not all parts of this small percentage are habitable.
1273. The distribution of population is found to be uneven in different parts of the world mainly due to different characteristics of land and climate.
1274. Rugged topography, steep slopes of mountains, low areas prone to floods, desert areas and dense forest areas are generally sparse or uninhabited.
1275. Suitable land for agriculture is available in fertile plains and river valleys.
1276. Therefore, these places are densely populated regions of the world.
1277. The land is used for various purposes, such as agriculture, forestry, mining, setting up of roads and industries.
1278. This is commonly referred to as land use.
1279. Can you list the different ways Mamba and Peter's families used land?
1280. Land use is determined by physical factors, such as topography, soil, climate, minerals and water availability.
1281. Human factors such as population and technology are also important determinants of land use patterns.
1282. On the basis of ownership, land can be divided into private land and community land.
1283. Private land is owned by individuals whereas community land is owned by the community.
1284. It is commonly used for individuals belonging to the community, such as gathering fodder, fruits, nuts or medicinal herbs.
1285. This community land is also called a common property resource.
1286. The population and their demand is always increasing but the availability of land is limited.
1287. The quality of the land varies according to the location.
1288. People have started making unauthorised interventions to build business areas on community land, build houses in urban areas and expand cultivable land in rural areas.
1289. Widespread changes in land use patterns today reflect cultural changes in our society.
1290. At present, due to the expansion of agriculture and construction related activities, degradation, landslides, soil erosion, desertification are the major threats to the environment.
1291. Due to the increasing population and its increasing demands, there has been large scale destruction of forest land and cultivable land.
1292. This has created a fear of depleting this natural resource.
1293. That is why the present rate of destruction must be stopped.
1294. Afforestation, land reclamation, regulated use of chemical pesticides and fertilizers and prevention of encroachment are some of the common methods used for land conservation.
1295. The thin layer of granular particles on the surface of the earth is called soil.
1296. It is closely connected to the land.
1297. Landforms determine the type of soil.
1298. Soil is made up of minerals and organic matter obtained from rocks and minerals found on land.
1299. It is formed through the process of weathering.
1300. The right mix of minerals and organic matter makes the soil fertile.
1301. The main factors of soil formation are the nature of parent rock and climatic factors.
1302. Other factors in soil formation are topography, the role of organic matter and the time taken in the composition of soil formation.
1303. These are different in different places.
1304. Soil erosion and degradation are the two main threats to soil resources.
1305. Soils can be degraded by both human and natural factors.
1306. Factors contributing to soil degradation are deforestation, encroachment, excessive use of chemical fertilizers and pesticides, rain exploitation, landslides and floods.
1307. Some of the methods of soil conservation are as follows.
1308. Making mulch The exposed land between plants is covered with organic matter such as coral.
1309. This keeps the moisture of the soil.
1310. Broad, flat steps or altars are built on steep slopes so that the flat surface becomes available for growing the crop.
1311. They reduce surface flow and soil erosion.
1312. Ploughing parallel to the contour lines on a hill slope forms a natural barrier for water flowing down the slope.
1313. In coastal areas and dry areas, trees are planted in rows to prevent wind movement so that the soil cover can be saved.
1314. Stones, grass, soil are used to make barriers on the contours.
1315. In front of the barriers, trenches are made to collect water.
1316. These are made to reduce the flow of water.
1317. They protect drains and prevent soil damage.
1318. To protect the soil from rain harvesting, different crops are grown in alternate rows at different times.
1319. Water is an important renewable natural resource, with three-quarters of the Earth's surface covered by water.
1320. That is why it is appropriate to call it a water planet.
1321. Life began in the early oceans, about 3.5 billion years ago.
1322. Although today the oceans cover two-thirds of the Earth's surface and support a wide variety of plants and animals.
1323. The water in the oceans is saline and not suitable for human consumption.
1324. Fresh water is only 2.7 percent.
1325. About 70 percent of this is found in the form of ice sheets and glaciers in Antarctica, Greenland and mountainous regions.
1326. Because of its position, it is beyond the reach of man.
1327. Only one percent of freshwater is available and that is suitable for human consumption.
1328. It is found in the form of surface water in groundwater, rivers and lakes and as water vapour in the atmosphere.
1329. Therefore, fresh water is the most valuable substance on earth.
1330. Water on earth cannot be increased or decreased.
1331. Its total volume remains constant.
1332. It appears to be diverse in abundance as it is constantly in motion by the processes of evaporation, precipitation and runoff in the oceans, air, land and again by cycling into the oceans.
1333. As you know this is called the water cycle.
1334. Humans use large amounts of water not only for drinking and washing, but also in the production process.
1335. Water is also used in agriculture, industries and to generate electricity through the reservoirs of dams.
1336. The main factors for the lack of supply of fresh water due to drying up of water bodies or water pollution are increasing population, increasing demand for food and cash crops, increasing urbanization and improving living standards.
1337. There is a shortage of water in many parts of the world.
1338. Most of Africa, western Asia, southern Asia, parts of the western United States, north-western Mexico, parts of South America and all of Australia are facing shortages of fresh water supplies.
1339. These countries are located in such climatic regions where droughts often occur.
1340. They have more problems of water scarcity.
1341. Thus, water scarcity may result from variations in seasonal or annual precipitation, or due to overuse and contamination of water sources.
1342. Access to pure and adequate water sources has become a major problem in today's world.
1343. Steps should be taken to conserve this depleting resource.
1344. Although water is a renewable resource, its overuse and pollution make it unfit for use.
1345. The major contaminants of water are untreated or partially treated sewage, effluents of agricultural chemicals and industrial effluents in water bodies.
1346. These include nitrate metals and pesticides, pollute the water.
1347. Most of these chemicals, being non-biodegradable, reach the human body through water.
1348. Water pollution can be controlled by treating the effluents with a suitable method before releasing these pollutants into the water bodies.
1349. Forests and other vegetation cover slow down surface runoff and replenish groundwater.
1350. Water harvesting is another method of saving surface flow.
1351. The canals that irrigate the fields should be properly paved to reduce water seepage.
1352. Irrigation of the area with sprinklers is a more effective method to prevent water loss due to seepage and evaporation.
1353. Drip or drip irrigation method is very useful in dry areas with high rate of evaporation.
1354. By adopting these methods of irrigation, valuable water resources can be conserved.
1355. School children were roaming in the handicrafts exhibition.
1356. The objects of the exhibition were collected from different parts of the country.
1357. Mona picked up a bag and said excitedly, it is a beautiful hand bag.
1358. The teacher said, yes, it is made of jute.
1359. Do you see those baskets, lampstands and chairs?
1360. They are made of cane and bamboo.
1361. Bamboo is grown in abundance in the eastern and north eastern wetlands of India.
1362. Jessie was excited to see the silk scarf.
1363. Look at this beautiful scarf.
1364. The teacher explained that silk is obtained from silkworms which are reared on mulberry trees.
1365. Children understood that plants provide us with many different products that we use in our daily lives.
1366. Natural vegetation and wildlife are found only in a narrow area connected between the lithosphere, the hydrosphere and the atmosphere, which we call the biosphere.
1367. All living species in the biosphere are interrelated and dependent on each other for survival.
1368. This life based system is called ecosystem.
1369. Vegetation and wildlife are valuable resources.
1370. Plants give us timber, provide shelter to animals, generate oxygen we breathe, protect soil needed to grow crops, act as protectors, help store groundwater. We provide you with fruits, latex, turpentine oil, gum, medicinal plants and paper which are very important for your studies.
1371. Plants have innumerable uses; you can add a few more to them.
1372. Wildlife includes animals, birds, insects and aquatic life forms.
1373. From them we get milk, meat, skin and wool.
1374. Insects such as bees give us honey, help pollinate flowers and play an important role as decomposers in the ecosystem.
1375. Birds depend on insects for their food and act as decomposers.
1376. Vultures are a scavenger due to their eating of dead animals and are considered to be an important purifier of the environment.
1377. Therefore, animals whether large or small are essential for maintaining the balance of the ecosystem.
1378. The growth of vegetation mainly depends on temperature and humidity.
1379. The main types of vegetation of the world can be classified into four categories, namely, forests, grasslands, gullies and tundra.
1380. Giant trees can grow in areas with heavy rainfall.
1381. Thus forests are found only in areas with abundant water supply.
1382. As the humidity decreases, so does the size and density of trees.
1383. Small-sized trees and grasses grow in areas of normal rainfall, which make up the grasslands of the world.
1384. Thorny bushes and gullies grow in dry areas with less rainfall.
1385. Plants have deep roots in these types of areas.
1386. The leaves of these trees have spines and waxy surfaces to reduce the loss of moisture due to transpiration.
1387. The tundra vegetation in the cold polar regions includes mosses and lichens.
1388. There are more people in the world than there were in the last two centuries.
1389. To feed the growing population, to grow crops, trees have been cut from vast areas of forests.
1390. The forest cover is rapidly depleting all over the world.
1391. There is an urgent need to conserve this valuable resource.
1392. Forest is our wealth.
1393. Plants provide shelter to animals and at the same time maintain the ecosystem.
1394. Changes in climate and human intervention can destroy the natural habitats of plants and animals.
1395. Many species are vulnerable or endangered and some are on the verge of extinction.
1396. Deforestation, soil erosion, construction work, forestry and landslides are some of the human and natural factors that together contribute to the process of extinction of these important natural resources.
1397. One of the main concerns today is the increase in poaching numbers, which have led to a rapid decline in the numbers of certain species.
1398. Animals have been poached for the collection and illegal trade of animal hides, leather, nails, teeth and feathers, as well as horns.
1399. Some of these animals are cheetah, lion, elephant, blackbuck, crocodile, hippopotamus, snow leopard, ostrich and peacock.
1400. Their protection can be done by increasing awareness.
1401. National parks, wildlife sanctuaries, biosphere reserves are created to protect our natural vegetation and wildlife.
1402. Conservation of narrow valleys, lakes and wetlands is essential to prevent the loss of valuable resources.
1403. If the relative number of species is not disturbed, the equilibrium in the environment is maintained.
1404. In many parts of the world, human activities have disturbed the natural habitats of many species.
1405. Due to the indiscriminate hunting of many birds and animals, they have either become extinct or are on the verge of extinction.
1406. Awareness programs like social forestry, Van Mahotsav should be encouraged at the regional and community level.
1407. School children should be encouraged to go to bird watching, nature camps so that they can observe the habitat of different species.
1408. Many countries are against killing and trading birds and animals.
1409. It is illegal to kill lions, cheetahs, deer, Indian sarong and peacock in India.
1410. An international convention CITES The Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora has been established which lists the many species of fauna and birds.
1411. Trading in all the birds and animals given in this list has been banned.
1412. Protection of plants and animals is the moral duty of every citizen.
1413. What are the two main climatic factors responsible for soil formation?
1414. Write any two reasons for land degradation.
1415. Why is land considered an important resource?
1416. Name any two steps which the government has started for the protection of plants and animals.
1417. Kiri was visiting Sukant in his native place near Dhanbad.
1418. Kiri was amazed to see that large areas were black.
1419. “Sukant, why is this place so black and dusty?”
1420. This is because of the coal mines nearby.
1421. Do you see the trucks?
1422. They are carrying the mineral coal
1423. Have you ever seen a baker baking biscuits?
1424. The flour, milk, sugar and sometimes eggs are mixed together.
1425. While eating the baked biscuits can you see these ingredients separately?
1426. just as in the biscuits, there are a number of things that you cannot see, rocks on this earth have several materials called minerals mixed in them.
1427. These minerals are scattered throughout the earth’s rocky crust”
1428. A naturally occurring substance that has a definite chemical composition is a mineral
1429. Minerals are not evenly distributed over space.
1430. They are concentrated in a particular area or rock formations.
1431. Some minerals are found in areas which are not easily accessible such as the Arctic ocean bed and Antarctica.
1432. Minerals are formed in different types of geological environments under varying conditions. 
1433. They are created by natural processes without any human interference.
1434. They can be identified on the basis of their physical properties such as colour, density, hardness and chemical properties such as solubility.
1435. There are over three thousand different minerals.
1436. Metallic minerals contain metal in raw form.
1437. Metals are hard substances that conduct heat and electricity and have a characteristic lustre or shine.
1438. Iron ore, bauxite, manganese ore are some examples.
1439. Ferrous minerals like iron ore, manganese and chromite contain iron.
1440. A non-ferrous mineral does not contain iron but may contain some other metal such as gold, silver, copper or lead.
1441. Non-metallic minerals do not contain metals.
1442. Limestone, mica and gypsum are examples of such minerals.
1443. The mineral fuels like coal and petroleum are also non-metallic minerals.
1444. Minerals can be extracted by mining, drilling or quarrying.
1445. The process of taking out minerals from rocks buried under the earth’s surface is called mining.
1446. Minerals that lie at shallow depths are taken out by removing the surface layer; this is known as open-cast mining.
1447. Deep bores, called shafts, have to be made to reach mineral deposits that lie at great depths.
1448. Minerals occur in different types of rocks.
1449. Some are found in igneous rocks, some in metamorphic rocks while others occur in sedimentary rocks.
1450. metallic minerals are found in igneous and metamorphic rock formations that form large plateaus.
1451. Iron-ore in north Sweden, copper and nickel deposits in Ontario, Canada, iron, nickel, chromites and platinum in South Africa are examples of minerals found in igneous and metamorphic rocks.
1452. Sedimentary rock formations of plains and young fold mountains contain non-metallic minerals like limestone
1453. Limestone deposits of Caucasus region of France, manganese deposits of Georgia and Ukraine and phosphate beds of Algeria are some examples.
1454. Mineral fuels such as coal and petroleum are also found in the sedimentary strata
1455. China and India have large iron ore deposits
1456. The continent produces more than half of the world’s tin.
1457. China, Malaysia and Indonesia are among the world’s leading tin producers
1458. China also leads in production of lead, antimony and tungsten.
1459. Asia also has deposits of manganese, bauxite, nickel, zinc and copper.
1460. Europe is the leading producer of iron-ore in the world.
1461. The countries with large deposits of iron ore are Russia, Ukraine, Sweden and France.
1462. Minerals deposits of copper, lead, zinc, manganese and nickel are found in eastern Europe and European Russia.
1463. Brazil is the largest producer of high grade iron-ore in the world.
1464. Chile and Peru are leading producers of copper.
1465. Brazil and Bolivia are among the world’s largest producers of tin.
1466. South America also has large deposits of gold, silver, zinc, chromium, manganese, bauxite, mica, platinum, asbestos and diamond.
1467. Mineral oil is found in Venezuela, Argentina, Chile, Peru and Columbia.
1468. Africa is rich in mineral resources.
1469.  It is the world’s largest producer of diamonds, gold and platinum.
1470. South Africa, Zimbabwe and Zaire produce a large portion of the world’s gold
1471. The other minerals found in Africa are copper, iron ore, chromium, uranium, cobalt and bauxite. 
1472. Oil is found in Nigeria, Libya and Angola.
1473. Australia is the largest producer of bauxite in the world.
1474. It is a leading producer of gold, diamond, iron ore, tin and nickel.
1475. It is also rich in copper, lead, zinc and manganese.
1476. Kalgoorlie and Coolgardie areas of western Australia have the largest deposits of gold.
1477. The geology of Antarctica is sufficiently well known to predict the existence of a variety of mineral deposits, some probably large.
1478. Significant size of deposits of coal in the Transantarctic Mountains and iron near the Prince Charles Mountains of East Antarctica is forecasted.
1479. Iron ore, gold, silver and oil are also present in commercial quantities.
1480. Minerals are used in many industries.
1481. Minerals which are used for gems are usually hard.
1482. These are then set in various styles for jewellery.
1483. Copper is another metal used in everything from coins to pipes.
1484. Silicon, used in the computer industry, is obtained from quartz.
1485. Minerals are a non-renewable resource.
1486. It takes thousands of years for the formation and concentration of minerals.
1487. The rate of formation is much smaller than the rate at which humans consume these minerals.
1488. It is necessary to reduce wastage in the process of mining.
1489. Recycling of metals is another way in which the mineral resources can be conserved.
1490. Sunny’s mother begins her day by switching on the geyser.
1491. She irons Sunny’s school uniform before waking him up.
1492. She then rushes to the kitchen to prepare a glass of orange juice for him in the blender.
1493. While going to school Sunny forgets to switch off lights and fans.
1494. When mother switches them off she thinks that life in the cities may be more comfortable, but its dependency on more and more gadgets all of which consume energy has led to a wide gap between the demand and the supply.
1495. With the advent of science and technology the lifestyles are changing very fast.
1496. Power or energy plays a vital role in our lives.
1497. We also need power for industry, agriculture, transport, communication and defence.
1498. Power resources may be broadly categorised as conventional and non-conventional resources.
1499. Conventional sources of energy are those which have been in common use for a long time.
1500. Firewood and fossil fuels are the two main conventional energy sources.
1501. It is widely used for cooking and heating.
1502. In our country more than fifty per cent of the energy used by villagers comes from fire wood.
1503. Remains of plants and animals which were buried under the earth for millions of years got converted by the heat and pressure into fossil fuels.
1504. Fossil fuel such as coal, petroleum and natural gas are the main sources of conventional energy.
1505. The reserves of these minerals are limited.
1506. The rate at which the growing world population is consuming them is far greater than the rate of their formation.
1507. So, these are likely to be exhausted soon
1508. This is the most abundantly found fossil fuel.
1509. It is used as a domestic fuel, in industries such as iron and steel, steam engines and to generate electricity.
1510. Electricity from coal is called thermal power.
1511. The coal which we are using today was formed millions of years ago when giant ferns and swamps got buried under the layers of earth.
1512. Coal is therefore referred to as Buried Sunshine.
1513. The petrol that keeps your car running as well as the oil that keeps your cycle from squeaking, both began as a thick black liquid called Petroleum.
1514. It is found between the layers of rocks and is drilled from oil fields located in off-shore and coastal areas.
1515. This is then sent to refineries which process the crude oil and produce a variety of products like diesel, petrol, kerosene, wax, plastics and lubricants.
1516. Petroleum and its derivatives are called Black Gold as they are very valuable.
1517. The chief petroleum producing countries are Iran, Iraq, Saudi Arabia and Qatar.
1518. The other major producers are the USA, Russia, Venezuela, and Algeria.
1519. The leading producers in India are Digboi in Assam, Bombay High in Mumbai and the deltas of Krishna and Godavari rivers.
1520. Natural gas is found with petroleum deposits and is released when crude oil is brought to the surface.
1521. It can be used as a domestic and industrial fuel.
1522. Russia, Norway, UK and the Netherlands are the major producers of natural gas.
1523. In India Jaisalmer, Krishna Godavari delta, Tripura and some areas offshore in Mumbai have natural gas resources.
1524. Very few countries in the world have sufficient natural gas reserves of their own.
1525. The sharp increase in our consumption of fossil fuels has led to their depletion at an alarming rate.
1526. The toxic pollutants released from burning these fuels are also a cause for concern.
1527. Unchecked burning of fossil fuel is like an unchecked dripping tap which will eventually run dry.
1528. This has led to the tapping of various non- conventional sources of energy that are cleaner alternatives to fossil fuels.
1529. Rain water or river water stored in dams is made to fall from heights.
1530. The falling water flows through pipes inside the dam over turbine blades placed at the bottom of the dam.
1531. The moving blades then turn the generator to produce electricity.
1532. This is called hydro electricity.
1533. The water discharged after the generation of electricity is used for irrigation.
1534. The leading producers of hydel power in the world are Paraguay, Norway, Brazil, and China.
1535. Some important hydel power stations in India are Bhakra Nangal, Gandhi Sagar, Nagarjunsagar and Damodar valley projects.
1536. The increasing use of fossil fuels is leading to its shortage.
1537. It is estimated that if the present rate of consumption continues, the reserves of these fuels will get exhausted.
1538. Moreover, their use also causes environmental pollution.
1539. Therefore, there is a need for using non-conventional sources such as solar energy, wind energy, tidal energy which are renewable.
1540. Sun’s heat and light energy can be felt by us everyday.
1541. Solar energy trapped from the sun can be used in solar cells to produce electricity.
1542. Many of these cells are joined into solar panels to generate power for heating and lighting purposes.
1543. Wind is an inexhaustible source of energy.
1544. Windmills have been used for grinding grain and lifting water since times immemorial.
1545. In modern time windmills, the high speed winds rotate the windmill which is connected to a generator to produce electricity.
1546. Wind farms having clusters of such wind mills are located in coastal regions and in mountain passes where strong and steady winds blow.
1547. Wind Farms are found in the Netherlands, Germany, Denmark, UK, USA and Spain are noted for their wind energy production.
1548. Nuclear power is obtained from energy stored in the nuclei of atoms of naturally occurring radioactive elements like uranium and thorium.
1549. These fuels undergo nuclear fission in nuclear reactors and emit Nuclear power stations.
1550. The greatest producers of nuclear power are the USA and Europe.
1551. In India Rajasthan and Jharkhand have large deposits of Uranium.
1552. Thorium is found in large quantities in the Monazite sands of Kerala.
1553. The nuclear power stations in India are located in Kalpakkam in Tamilnadu, Tarapur in Maharashtra, Ranapratap Sagar near Kota in Rajasthan, Narora in Uttar Pradesh and Kaiga in Karnataka.
1554. Heat energy obtained from the earth is called geothermal energy.
1555. The temperature in the interior of the earth rises steadily as we go deeper.
1556. Sometimes this heat energy may surface itself in the form of hot springs
1557. This heat energy can be used to generate power.
1558. The USA has the world’s largest geothermal power plants followed by New Zealand, Iceland, Philippines and Central America.
1559. In India, geothermal plants are located in Manikaran in Himachal Pradesh and Puga Valley in Ladakh.
1560. Organic waste such as dead plant and animal material, animal dung and kitchen waste can be converted into a gaseous fuel called biogas.
1561. The organic waste is decomposed by bacteria in biogas digesters to emit biogas which is essentially a mixture of methane and carbon dioxide.
1562. Biogas is an excellent fuel for cooking and lighting and produces huge amounts of organic manure each year.
1563. Energy is everywhere but we can see that harnessing this energy is both Biogas difficult as well as costly.
1564. Each one of us can make a difference by not wasting energy.
1565. Energy saved is energy generated.
1566. Act now and make a brighter energy future.
1567. Compressed natural gas (CNG) is a popular eco- friendly automobile fuel as it causes less pollution than petroleum and diesel.
1568. Norway was the first country in the world to develop hydroelectricity.
1569. The site of the world’s first solar and wind powered bus shelter is in Scotland.
1570. The first tidal energy station was built in France.
1571. The oldest rocks in the world are in Western Australia.
1572. Gurpreet, Madhu and Tina were passing through a village, where they saw a farmer ploughing the field.
1573. The farmer told them that he was going to sow wheat and had just applied manure to make the soil more fertile.
1574. He told the children that wheat would be sold at a good price in the market, from where it would be converted into flour and taken to the factory to make bread and biscuits.
1575. There are three types of economic activities involved in the conversion from plant to finished product.
1576. These are primary, secondary and tertiary actions.
1577. Under primary activities all those activities are included which are related to production and extraction of natural resources.
1578. Agriculture, fishing and harvesting are good examples of these.
1579. Secondary actions are related to the processing of these resources.
1580. Steel manufacturing, bread baking and cloth weaving are examples of these activities.
1581. Tertiary activities provide support to the primary and secondary sectors through service functions.
1582. Examples of tertiary activities are traffic, trade, banking, insurance and advertising.
1583. Agriculture is a primary activity.
1584. It includes growing crops, fruits, vegetables, flowers and rearing livestock.
1585. Fifty percent of the people in the world are engaged in activities related to agriculture.
1586. Two-thirds of India's population is still dependent on agriculture.
1587. Favourable topography, soil and climate are essential for agricultural activity.
1588. The land on which crops are grown is called agricultural land.
1589. You can see in the map that agricultural activities are concentrated in those regions of the world where suitable factors exist for growing crops.
1590. Agriculture or farming can be seen as a system.
1591. Its important inputs are seeds, fertilisers, machinery and labour.
1592. Ploughing, sowing, irrigation, weeding and harvesting are some of its operations.
1593. The outputs of this system include crops, wool, dairy and poultry products.
1594. Agriculture is done in different ways in the world.
1595. On the basis of geographical conditions, demand for the product, level of labor and technology, agriculture can be classified into two main types.
1596. These are subsistence agriculture and commercial agriculture.
1597. This type of agriculture is done to meet the needs of the farming family.
1598. Traditionally low-level technology and family labour are used to achieve low yields.
1599. Subsistence agriculture can be further classified into intensive subsistence agriculture and primitive subsistence agriculture.
1600. In intensive subsistence agriculture, the farmer cultivates a small plot of land with simple tools and more labour.
1601. In a climate with more sunny days and a field with fertile soil, more than one crop can be grown in a year.
1602. Rice is the main crop.
1603. Other crops include wheat, maize, pulses and oilseeds.
1604. Intensive subsistence agriculture is prevalent in the densely populated monsoon regions of South, South-East and East Asia.
1605. Primitive subsistence agriculture includes shifting agriculture and nomadic pastoralism.
1606. Shifting agriculture is practised in the densely forested areas of the Amazon Basin, parts of tropical Africa, south-east Asia and north-east India.
1607. These are areas of heavy rainfall and rapid regeneration of vegetation.
1608. The plot is cleared by cutting down trees and burning them.
1609. The ash is then mixed with the soil and crops such as maize, yam, potato and cassava are grown.
1610. After the fertility of the land is exhausted, that land is released and the farmer moves to the new plot.
1611. Shifting agriculture is also known as shearing and combustion agriculture.
1612. Nomadic pastoralism is prevalent in the semi-arid and arid regions of the Sahara, Central Asia and some parts of India such as Rajasthan and Jammu and Kashmir.
1613. In this type of agriculture, pastoralists move from one place to another on fixed routes for fodder and water with their animals.
1614. This type of activity occurs in response to climatic constraints and terrain.
1615. Pastoralists mainly rear sheep, camels, cattle, yaks and goats.
1616. They provide milk, meat, wool, hides and other products for pastoralists and their families.
1617. In commercial agriculture, crop production and animal husbandry are done for sale in the market.
1618. In this, a wide cultivated area and more capital are used.
1619. Most of the work is done by machines.
1620. Commercial agriculture includes commercial grain farming, mixed farming, and plantation agriculture.
1621. In commercial grain agriculture, crops are grown for commercial purposes.
1622. Wheat and maize are commonly grown crops.
1623. The temperate grasslands of North America, Europe and Asia are major areas of commercial grain agriculture.
1624. These areas are sparsely populated with large farms of hundreds of hectares.
1625. Extreme cold disrupts the growth period and only one crop can be grown.
1626. In mixed agriculture, the land is used for growing food and fodder crops and for livestock rearing.
1627. It is prevalent in Europe, the eastern United States, Argentina, south-eastern Australia, New Zealand and South Africa.
1628. Plantation agriculture is a type of commercial agriculture where a single crop of tea, coffee, cashew, rubber, banana or cotton is grown.
1629. It requires a huge amount of labor and capital.
1630. Product processing can be done on the farm itself or in nearby factories.
1631. Thus, the development of a transport network is essential in this agriculture.
1632. The main areas of plantation agriculture are found in the tropical regions of the world.
1633. Rubber in Malaysia, Kahwa in Brazil, tea in India and Sri Lanka are some examples.
1634. A variety of crops are grown to meet the needs of the growing population.
1635. Crops also supply raw materials for agro-based industries.
1636. Wheat, rice, maize and millet are the main food crops.
1637. Jute and cotton are fiber crops.
1638. Tea and Kahwa are the main beverage crops.
1639. Rice is the main food crop of the world.
1640. It is the staple diet of tropical and sub-tropical regions.
1641. Rice requires high temperature, high humidity and rainfall.
1642. This crop grows best in glazed alluvial soil which has water holding capacity.
1643. China is a leader in rice production.
1644. It is followed by India, Japan, Sri Lanka and Egypt respectively.
1645. In favorable climatic conditions like West Bengal and Bangladesh, two to three crops are grown in a year.
1646. Wheat Wheat requires moderate temperature and rainfall during the growing season and strong sunlight at the time of harvesting.
1647. It grows best in well-drained loamy soils.
1648. Wheat is widely grown in the USA, Canada, Argentina, Russia, Ukraine, Australia and India.
1649. In India it is grown in winter.
1650. Millets These are also known as coarse cereals and can be grown in less fertile and loamy soils.
1651. It is a crop that requires low rainfall and high to moderate temperatures and sufficient sunlight.
1652. Jowar, Bajra and Ragi are grown in India.
1653. Other producing countries are Nigeria, China and Niger.
1654. Maize It requires moderate temperature, rainfall and more sunlight.
1655. It requires well-drained fertile soil.
1656. Maize is grown in North America, Brazil, China, Russia, Canada, India and Mexico.
1657. Cotton requires high temperature, light rainfall, two hundred to two hundred and ten frost-free days and bright sunlight for its growth.
1658. It grows best in black and alluvial soils.
1659. China, the United States, India, Pakistan, Brazil and Egypt are the leading producers of cotton.
1660. It is an important raw material for the cotton textile industry.
1661. Jute is also known as golden fiber.
1662. It grows well in alluvial soil and requires high temperature, heavy rainfall and humid climate.
1663. This crop is grown in tropical regions.
1664. India and Bangladesh are the leading producers of jute.
1665. Coffee requires a hot and humid climate and well-drained loamy soil.
1666. Hill slopes are more suitable for the growth of this crop.
1667. Brazil is the leading producer of coffee.
1668. This is followed by Colombia and India.
1669. Tea is a beverage crop grown in plantations.
1670. The growth of its tender leaves requires a cool climate and high rainfall evenly distributed throughout the year.
1671. It requires well-drained loamy soil and low slope.
1672. More number of workers are required for picking the leaves.
1673. Agricultural development is concerned with the efforts made in the direction of increasing the production of agriculture to meet the increasing demand of the growing population.
1674. This can be achieved in many ways such as by expanding the area sown, increasing the number of crops to be sown, improving irrigation facilities, using fertilizers and high yielding seeds.
1675. Mechanisation of agriculture is also another aspect of the development of agriculture.
1676. The ultimate goal of the development of agriculture is to increase food security.
1677. Agriculture has developed at different speeds in different parts of the world.
1678. Developing countries with high populations practice mostly intensive agriculture, where smallholdings are usually grown for subsistence crops.
1679. Larger holdings are more suitable for commercial agriculture, such as in the United States, Canada and Australia.
1680. Come, let us learn about the agriculture of developing and developed countries with the help of situation studies of two farms, one in India and the other in the United States of America.
1681. Adilabad is a small village in the Ghazipur district of Uttar Pradesh.
1682. Munnalal is a small farmer of this village having a farm of about 1.5 hectares.
1683. His residence is in the main village.
1684. He buys high yielding seeds from the market at intervals of years.
1685. His land is fertile and he grows at least two crops, usually wheat or rice and pulses, in a year.
1686. The farmer takes advice from his friends and elders as well as government agriculture officials regarding agricultural works.
1687. He takes tractors on hire to plough his fields, although some of his friends still use the traditional method of ploughing the fields with oxen.
1688. There is a tube well in a nearby field, which he takes on rent to irrigate his field.
1689. Munnalal also has two buffaloes and some hens.
1690. He sells milk in a cooperative store located in a nearby town.
1691. He is a member there.
1692. The cooperative society also gives advice regarding the type of feed for its animals, measures to protect the health of livestock and artificial insemination.
1693. All the members of the family help him in various agricultural activities.
1694. Sometimes he takes loans from banks or agricultural co-operative societies to buy high yielding varieties of seeds and tools.
1695. He sells his product in the mandi located in the nearby town.
1696. Most of the farmers lack storage facilities, so they are forced to sell their produce even if the market is not favourable.
1697. In recent years, the government has taken some steps to develop storage facilities.
1698. The average size of a farm in the United States is much larger than that of an Indian farm.
1699. The size of a typical farm in the United States is 250 hectares.
1700. The farmer usually lives on the farm.
1701. Maize, soybean, wheat and sugar beet are some of the important crops grown here.
1702. Joe Horan, a farmer from the state of Iowa, located in the midwest of the United States, owns 300 hectares of land.
1703. He grows maize in his field when he is sure that the soil and water resources will meet the needs of this crop.
1704. Adequate measures are taken to control the pests causing damage to the crop.
1705. From time to time, he sends the soil samples to the soil testing laboratory to check whether it has sufficient nutrients or not.
1706. These results are what help Horan plan a scientific fertilizer program.
1707. His computer is connected to a satellite which gives him an accurate picture of his farm.
1708. It helps him to use chemical fertilizers and pesticides as per the requirement.
1709. He uses tractors, seed planters, levellers, combined harvesters and threshers for various agricultural operations.
1710. The grains are stored in automated granaries or sent to market agencies.
1711. In the United States, the farmer acts as a businessman and not as an agricultural farmer.
1712. What is agriculture?
1713. Name the factors which are affecting agriculture.
1714. What is shifting agriculture?
1715. What are the disadvantages of this agriculture?
1716. What is Plantation Agriculture?
1717. How does the government help farmers in the development of agriculture?
1718. Agriculture is a primary activity in India.
1719. Different crops are grown in different regions.
1720. Collect the seeds of wheat, rice, jowar, bajra, ragi, maize, oilseeds and pulses available in the jar.
1721. Bring them into the classroom and find out what type of soil they grow in.
1722. Have you ever thought that the writing exercise book that you use comes to you after a long process of manufacturing?
1723. Its life begins with a tree.
1724. It is harvested and taken to the pulp-mill.
1725. There the wood of the trees is processed and converted into wood pulp.
1726. The wood pulp is mixed with chemicals and eventually converted into paper by machines.
1727. This paper goes to the press where inks made from chemicals are used to print lines on the pages.
1728. The pages are then tied up and packed in the form of exercise books and sent to the market for sale.
1729. In the end it reaches your hands.
1730. Secondary activity or manufacturing involves converting raw materials into products of higher value to the people, as you have seen, pulp in the form of paper and paper in the form of exercise books.
1731. These represent the two stages of the manufacturing process.
1732. Industry refers to the economic activity which is related to production of goods, extraction of minerals or provision of services.
1733. Thus the iron and steel industry is related to the production of goods, the coal mining industry is related to the extraction of coal from the earth and tourism is an industry related to service delivery.
1734. classification of industries
1735. Industries can be classified on the basis of raw material, size and ownership.
1736. Raw Material Industries can be agro based, mineral based, sea based and forest based depending on the raw material used.
1737. Agro based industries use plant and animal based products as raw material.
1738. Food processing, vegetable oil, cotton textiles, dairy products and leather industries are examples of agro-based industries.
1739. Mineral based industries are the primary industries which use mineral ores as raw material.
1740. The products of these industries nourish other industries.
1741. Iron produced from ore is the product of mineral based industry.
1742. It is used as a raw material for the manufacture of many other products such as heavy machinery, building materials and railway coaches.
1743. Sea based industries use products from the oceans and oceans as raw materials.
1744. Some examples are the seafood processing industry and fish oil manufacturing.
1745. Forest based industries use forest produce as raw material.
1746. Pulp and paper, pharmaceutical chemicals, furniture and building construction are industries related to forests.
1747. Size The size of the industry refers to the amount of capital invested, the number of people employed and the amount of production.
1748. On the basis of size, industries can be divided into two types, small scale industries and large scale industries.
1749. Cottage or household industries are small scale industries in which products are made by hand by artisans.
1750. Basket weaving, pottery and other handmade items are examples of cottage industries.
1751. Small scale industries use less capital and technology as compared to large scale industries which produce large quantities of goods.
1752. In large scale industries, the investment of capital is high and the technology used is high level.
1753. Sericulture and food processing industries are small scale industries.
1754. The production of automobiles and heavy machines are large scale industries.
1755. On the basis of ownership, industries can be classified into private sector, state owned or public sector, joint sector and cooperative sector.
1756. Private sector industries are owned and operated either by an individual or by a group of individuals.
1757. Public sector industries are owned and operated by the government such as Hindustan Aeronautics Limited and Steel Authority of India Limited.
1758. Joint sector industries are owned and operated by states and individuals or groups of individuals.
1759. Maruti Udyog Limited is an example of a joint sector industry.
1760. Industries in the co-operative sector are owned and operated by producers or suppliers of raw materials, workers or both.
1761. Anand Milk Union Limited and Sudha Dairy are the best examples of cooperative undertaking.
1762. Factors Affecting Location of Industries
1763. The factors which affect the location of industries are availability of raw materials, land, water, labour, power, capital, transport and market.
1764. Industries are concentrated in those places where some or all of these factors are readily available.
1765. Sometimes the government provides incentives like availability of electricity at low cost, low transportation cost and other infrastructure so that industries can be set up in backward areas also.
1766. Industrialization often leads to the growth and development of towns and cities.
1767. The industrial system includes input, process and output.
1768. Investments include the cost of raw materials, labour and land, availability of water, transportation, power and other infrastructure.
1769. Processing involves a variety of activities that convert raw materials into finished goods.
1770. Output is the final product and income earned from it.
1771. In the context of cotton textiles, cotton, human labour, factory and transportation costs may be inputs.
1772. Processes include ginning, harvesting, weaving, dyeing and printing.
1773. The shirt you wear is a production.
1774. The development of an industrial region occurs when several types of industries are located close to each other and they share the benefits of their proximity.
1775. The major industrial regions of the world are Northeast America, Western and Central Europe, Eastern Europe and East Asia.
1776. Major industrial regions are mostly located in the temperate zone, near sea ports and especially near coal fields.
1777. There are many industrial regions in India, such as Mumbai-Pune cluster, Bangalore, Tamil Nadu region, Hooghly region, Ahmedabad-Vadodara region, Chotanagpur industrial region, Visakhapatnam, Guntur industrial region, Gurgaon-Delhi-Meerut industrial region and Kollam-Thiruvananthapuram industrial region.
1778. The major industries of the world are iron-steel industry, cotton textile industry and information technology industry.
1779. Iron-steel industry and textile industry are very old industries while the information technology industry is a new emerging industry.
1780. The countries in which iron-steel industries are located are Germany, United States of America, China, Japan and Russia.
1781. The textile industry is concentrated in India, Hong Kong, South Korea, Japan and Taiwan.
1782. The main centers of the information technology industry are in the Silicon Valley of central California and in the Indian state of Bangalore.
1783. Like other industries, the iron and steel industry also involves a number of inputs, processes and outputs.
1784. It is a nutritive industry whose products are used as raw materials for other industries.
1785. Investments for industry include iron ore, coal and limestone as raw materials, along with labour, capital, space and other infrastructure.
1786. The process of manufacturing steel from iron-ore involves several stages.
1787. The raw material is put in a blast furnace where it is smelted.
1788. After that it is refined.
1789. The product obtained is steel which can be used as raw material in other industries.
1790. Steel is tough and can be easily cut and shaped or wire can be made from it.
1791. Alloys can be made by mixing small amounts of other metals like aluminium, nickel, copper in steel.
1792. The alloy gives steel unusual hardness, toughness and corrosion resistance.
1793. Steel is often called the backbone of modern industries.
1794. Almost all the things that we consume are either made of iron or steel or are made of tools and machines made from these metals.
1795. Ships, trains, trucks and autos are mostly made of steel.
1796. Even the safety pins and needles you use are made of steel.
1797. Oil-wells are drilled by machines made of steel.
1798. Oil is transported through steel pipelines.
1799. Minerals are mined with steel tools.
1800. Agricultural implements are usually made of steel.
1801. The structure of huge buildings is made of steel.
1802. Before 1800 AD, steel industries were located where raw materials, electricity supply and running water were easily available.
1803. Later the ideal conditions for industry were near coalfields, near canals and railways.
1804. After 1950, iron and steel industries began to be concentrated in vast areas of flat land near the seaport.
1805. This happened because the work of steel making had become very large by this time and iron-ore had to be imported from abroad.
1806. Iron and steel industries in India developed taking advantage of raw material, cheap labour, transport and market.
1807. All the important steel producing centers like Bhilai, Durgapur, Burnpur, Jamshedpur, Rourkela, Bokaro are located in a single region which is spread over four states.
1808. Those four states are West Bengal, Jharkhand, Odisha and Chhattisgarh.
1809. Bhadravati and Vijayanagara in Karnataka, Visakhapatnam in Andhra Pradesh, Salem in Tamil Nadu are other important steel centers using local resources.
1810. Jamshedpur, Before 1947, there was only one steel plant in India, Tata Iron and Steel Company Limited, TISCO.
1811. It was privately owned.
1812. After independence, the government took up this task and established many iron and steel plants.
1813. TISCO was started in 1907 at Sakchi, near the confluence of the Swarnrekha and Kharkai rivers in Jharkhand.
1814. Later the name of Sakchi was changed to Jamshedpur.
1815. Geographically, Jamshedpur is the most convenient place as an iron-steel center in the country.
1816. Sakchi was chosen to set up a steel plant for several reasons.
1817. This place is just 32 km from Kalimati station on the Bengal-Nagpur railway line. was at a distance.
1818. This place was also close to Kolkata with iron-ore, coal and manganese deposits, where a huge market was available.
1819. TISCO gets coal from Jharia coalfields and iron ore, limestone, dolomite and manganese from Odisha and Chhattisgarh.
1820. The Kharkai and Swarna Rekha rivers provide adequate water supply.
1821. Adequate capital was made available to it by government incentives.
1822. After the establishment of TISCO in Jamshedpur many other industrial plants were established.
1823. These include the production of chemicals, engine parts, agricultural equipment, machines, tin sheets, cables and wires.
1824. Rapid industrial development started with the development of iron and steel industry in India.
1825. Almost all sectors of Indian industry are largely dependent on the iron and steel industry for their basic infrastructure.
1826. The Indian iron and steel industry includes large integrated steel plants as well as small steel mills.
1827. It also includes secondary producers, rolling mills and ancillary industries.
1828. Pittsburgh is an important steel city in the United States.
1829. Local facilities are available to Pittsburgh's steel industry.
1830. Raw materials such as coal are available only in Pittsburgh, while iron-ore is obtained from iron mines in Minnesota, about 1500 km from Pittsburgh.
1831. The best route of shipping between these mines and Pittsburgh is the Great Lakes Waterway.
1832. It is the cheapest route for the shipping of ore.
1833. Iron-ore is brought by trains from the Great Lakes to the Pittsburgh area.
1834. The Ohio, Monoghella and Elghani rivers provide sufficient water.
1835. There are very few large steel mills in Pittsburgh today.
1836. The mill is located in the Monongahela and Allegheny River valleys above Pittsburgh and along the Ohio River below Pittsburgh.
1837. Refined steel is sent to the market by both land and water routes.
1838. In addition to steel mills, there are many other factories in the Pittsburgh area.
1839. They use steel as a raw material in the production of railways, railroad equipment and heavy machinery.
1840. Weaving cloth with thread is an ancient art.
1841. Cotton, wool, silk, jute and jute are used in the manufacture of textiles.
1842. The textile industry can be classified on the basis of the raw material used.
1843. Fibers are the raw material of the textile industry.
1844. Fibers can be natural or man-made.
1845. Natural fibers are obtained from wool, silk, cotton, linen and jute.
1846. Man-made fibers include nylon, polyester, acrylic and rayon.
1847. Cotton textile industry is one of the oldest industries in the world.
1848. Until the industrial revolution of the 18th century, cotton textiles were made with hand-spinning techniques and handlooms.
1849. In the 18th century, the powerloom led to the development of the cotton textile industry, first in Britain and later in other parts of the world.
1850. Today India, China, Japan and the United States are important producers of cotton.
1851. India has a proud tradition of producing finest quality cotton textiles.
1852. Before British rule, there was a vast Indian market for hand spun and hand woven fabrics.
1853. The muslins of Dhaka, the chintzes of Masulipatnam, the calicos of Calicut and the golden zari work cotton textiles of Burhanpur, Surat and Vadodara were world-renowned for their quality and designs.
1854. But being made by hand, the production of cotton cloth was expensive and took a long time to make.
1855. Therefore, the traditional cotton textile industry could not compete with the new textile mills of the West, which manufactured cheap and good quality fabrics in mechanized industrial units.
1856. The first successful mechanized textile mill was established in Mumbai in 1854 AD.
1857. The warm humid climate, ports for importing machines, availability of raw materials and skilled labor helped in the rapid expansion of this industry in the region.
1858. Initially this industry flourished due to favorable humid climate in the state of Maharashtra and Gujarat.
1859. But at present moisture can be generated artificially and raw cotton is pure and it does not lose weight in the textile production process, so this industry has spread to different parts of India.
1860. Coimbatore, Kanpur, Chennai, Ahmedabad, Mumbai, Kolkata, Ludhiana, Puducherry and Panipat are some of the other important centres.
1861. Ahmedabad is situated on the banks of the Sabarmati River in Gujarat.
1862. The first cotton mill was established here in 1859.
1863. It soon became the second largest textile city in India after Mumbai.
1864. Ahmedabad is often called the Manchester of India.
1865. Favorable location factors were helpful in the development of the cotton textile industry in Ahmedabad.
1866. Ahmedabad is located very close to the cotton growing area.
1867. Raw material is easily available here.
1868. The climate is ideal for spinning and weaving.
1869. The flat terrain and easy availability of land are suitable for setting up mills.
1870. The dense population of Gujarat and Maharashtra states provide skilled and semi-skilled labor to this industry.
1871. The network of well developed roads and railways helps in easy transportation of cotton textiles to different parts of the country.
1872. In this way it has easy access to the market.
1873. The nearby Mumbai port allows it to import machines and export cotton textiles.
1874. But in recent years, the cotton mills of Ahmedabad have some problems.
1875. Many textile mills have closed.
1876. The main reason for this is the development of new textile centers in the country and non-renewal of machine technology in the mills of Ahmedabad.
1877. Osaka Osaka is an important textile manufacturing center in Japan.
1878. It is also known as Manchester of Japan.
1879. The development of the cotton textile industry in Osaka is due to several geographical reasons.
1880. The wide plains around Osaka ensure easy availability of land for the development of cotton textile mills.
1881. The warm humid climate is very suitable for spinning and weaving.
1882. The Yodo River provides enough water for the mills.
1883. Workers are easily available.
1884. The location of the port facilitates import of raw cotton and export of textiles.
1885. Osaka's textile industry is completely dependent on imported raw materials.
1886. Cotton is produced in Egypt, India, China and the USA. is imported from.
1887. The finished product is mostly exported.
1888. It has a good market because of its high quality and low price.
1889. Although it is an important industry in the country, Osaka's cotton textile industry has recently been replaced by other industries, such as iron-steel, machinery, shipping, automobiles, electrical equipment and cement.
1890. What is meant by the word industry?
1891. What are the main factors that affect the location of the industry?
1892. Which industry is often called the backbone of modern industry and why?
1893. Why has the cotton industry developed rapidly in Mumbai?
1894. People are a nation’s greatest resource.
1895. Nature’s bounty becomes significant only when people find it useful. 
1896. It is people with their demands and abilities that turn them into ‘resources’.
1897. Hence, human resource is the ultimate resource.
1898. Healthy, educated and motivated people develop resources as per their requirements.
1899. Human resources like other resources are not equally distributed over the world.
1900. They differ in their educational levels, age and sex.
1901. Their numbers and characteristics also keep changing.
1902. The way in which people are spread across the earth's surface is known as the pattern of population distribution.
1903. More than 90 per cent of the world’s population lives in about 30 percent of the land surface.
1904. The distribution of population in the world is extremely uneven.
1905. Some areas are very crowded and some are sparsely populated.
1906. The crowded areas are south and southeast Asia, Europe and north eastern North America.
1907. Very few people live in high latitude areas, tropical deserts, high mountains and areas of equatorial forests.
1908. Many more people live north of the Equator than south of the Equator.
1909. Almost three-quarters of the world’s people live in two continents: Asia and Africa.
1910. Sixty per cent of the world’s people stay in just 10 countries.
1911. All of them have more than 100 million people.
1912. Population density is the number of people living in a unit area of the earth’s surface.
1913. It is normally expressed as per square km.
1914. The average density of population in the whole world is 51 persons per square km.
1915. South Central Asia has the highest density of population followed by East and SouthEast Asia.
1916. Topography: People always prefer to live on plains rather than mountains and plateaus because these areas are suitable for farming, manufacturing and service activities.
1917. The Ganga plains are the most densely populated areas of the world while mountains like Andes, Alps and Himalayas are sparsely populated.
1918. Climate: People usually avoid extreme climates that are very hot or very cold like the Sahara desert, polar regions of Russia, Canada and Antarctica.
1919. Soil: Fertile soils provide suitable land for agriculture.
1920. Fertile plains such as Ganga and Brahmaputra in India, Hwang-He, Chang Jiang in China and the Nile in Egypt are densely populated.
1921. Water: People prefer to live in the areas where freshwater is easily available.
1922. The river valleys of the world are densely populated while deserts have spare populations.
1923. Minerals: Areas with mineral deposits are more populated.
1924. Diamond mines of South Africa and discovery of oil in the Middle east lead to settling of people in these areas.
1925. Social: Areas of better housing, education and health facilities are more densely populated e.g., Pune.
1926. Culture: Places with religion or Culture significance attract people.
1927. Varanasi, Jerusalem and Vatican city are some examples.
1928. Economic: Industrial areas provide employment opportunities.
1929. Large number of people are attracted to these areas.
1930. Osaka in Japan and Mumbai in India are two densely populated areas.
1931. The population change refers to change in the number of people during a specific time.
1932. The world population has not been stable.
1933. It has increased manifold as seen in Fig 6.3.
1934. Why? This is actually due to changes in the number of births and deaths.
1935. For an extremely long period of human history, until the 1800s, the world’s population grew steadily but slowly.
1936. Large numbers of babies were born, but they died early too.
1937. This was as there were no proper health facilities.
1938. Sufficient food was not available for all the people.
1939. Farmers were not able to produce enough to meet the food requirements of all the people.
1940. As a result the total increase in population was very low.
1941. In 1804, the world’s population reached one billion.
1942. A hundred and fifty five years later, in 1959, the world’s population reached 3 billion.
1943. This is often called population explosion.
1944. In 1999, 40 years later, the population doubled to 6 billion.
1945. The main reason for this growth was that with better food supplies and medicine, deaths were reducing.
1946. while the number of births still remained fairly high.
1947. Births are usually measured using the birth rate i.e.
1948. The number of live births per 1,000 people.
1949. Deaths are usually measured using the death rate i.e. the number of deaths per 1,000 people.
1950. Migration is the movement of people in and out of an area.
1951. Births and deaths are the natural causes of population change.
1952. The difference between the birth rate and the death rate of a country is called the natural growth rate.
1953. The population increase in the world is mainly due to rapid increase in natural growth rate.
1954. Migration is another way by which population size changes.
1955. People may move within a country or between countries.
1956. Emigrants are people who leave a country; Immigrants are those who arrive in a country.
1957. Countries like the United States of America and Australia have gained in-numbers by in-migration or immigration.
1958. Sudan is an example of a country that has experienced a loss in population numbers due to out-migration or emigration.
1959. The general trend of international migrations is from the less developed nations to the more developed nations in search of better employment opportunities.
1960. Within countries a large number of people may move from the rural to urban areas in search of employment, education and health facilities.
1961. Rates of population growth vary across the world .
1962. Although the world’s total population is rising rapidly, not all countries are experiencing this growth.
1963. Some countries like Kenya have high population growth rates.
1964. They had both high birth rates and death rates.
1965. Now, with improving health care, death rates have fallen, but birth rates still remain high leading to high growth rates.
1966. In other countries like the United Kingdom, population growth is slowing because of both low death and low birth rates.
1967. To understand the role of people as a resource, we need to know more about their qualities.
1968. how many are males or females, which age group they belong to, how educated they are and what type of occupations they are employed in, what their income levels and health conditions are.
1969. An interesting way of studying the population composition of a country is by looking at the population pyramid, also called an age-sex pyramid.
1970. The total population is divided into various age groups, e.g., 5 to 9 years, 10 to 14 years.
1971. The percentage of the total population, subdivided into males and females, in each of those groups.
1972. The shape of the population pyramid tells the story of the people living in that particular country.
1973. The numbers of children (below 15 years) are shown at the bottom and reflect the level of births.
1974. The size of the top shows the numbers of aged people (above 65 years) and reflects the number of deaths.
1975. There are two groups of dependents — young dependents (aged below 15 years) and elderly dependents (aged over 65 years).
1976. The population pyramid of a country in which birth and death rates bothe are high is broad at the base and Pyramid of Kenya rapidly narrows towards the top.
1977. This is because although many children are born, a large percentage of them die in their infancy, relatively few become adults and there are very few old people.
1978. This situation is typified by the pyramid shown for Kenya.
1979. In countries where death rates (especially amongst the very young) are decreasing, the pyramid is broad in the younger age groups, because more infants survive to adulthood.
1980. Such populations contain a relatively large number of young people and which means a strong and ever increasing labour force.
1981. In countries like Japan, low birth rates make the pyramid narrow at the base.
1982. Skilled, spirited and hopeful young people endowed with a positive outlook are the future of any nation. 
1983. Decreased death rate allows numbers of people to reach old age.
1984. We in India are fortunate to have such a resource.
1985. They must be educated and provided skills and opportunities to become able and productive in the Population Pyramid.
1986. Why are people considered a resource?
1987. What are the causes for the uneven distribution of population in the world?
1988. The world population has grown very rapidly. Why?
1989. Discuss the role of any two factors influencing population change.
1990. What is meant by population composition?
1991. What are population pyramids?
1992. How do they help in understanding the population of a country?
1993. Which does the term population distribution refer to?
1994. How the population in a specified area changes over time.
1995. the number of people who die in relation to the number of people born in a specified area.
1996. When the population density of an area is so high that people live in tall buildings.
1997. Can I play detective and investigate the population of a country?
1998. It shows the present number of males and females in a country along with their age groups.
1999. Life expectancy It is the number of years that an average person can expect to live.
2000. When all the 30 students are present, our classroom seems very crowded.
2001. But when the same class is seated in the school assembly hall, it seems so open and empty. Why?
2002. Because the size or area of the hall is much larger than that of the classroom.
2003. However, when all the students of the school come into the hall, the hall too starts looking crowded.
2004. The objective of this scheme is to encourage aptitude towards employable skills by giving quality training to probable and existing wage earners.
2005. In Chapter 1 you have learnt that early human beings depended entirely on nature for food, clothing and shelter. 
2006. but with time they learnt new skills to grow food, build homes and develop better means of transport and communication.
2007. In this way they modified the environment where they lived
2008. Settlements are places where people build their homes.
2009. Early human beings lived on trees and in caves.
2010. When they started to grow crops it became necessary to have a permanent home
2011. The settlements grew near the river valleys as water was available and land was fertile.
2012. With the development of trade, commerce and manufacturing, human settlements became larger.
2013. Settlement flourished and civilizations developed near river valleys.
2014. Do you recall the names of civilizations that grew along the banks of rivers Indus, Tigris, Nile and Hwang-He.
2015. Settlements can be permanent or temporary.
2016. Settlements which are occupied for a short time are called temporary settlements.
2017. The people living in deep forests, hot and cold deserts and mountains often dwell in such temporary settlements.
2018. They practice hunting, gathering, shifting cultivation and transhumance.
2019. However more and more settlements today are permanent settlements
2020. In these settlements, people build homes to live in.
2021. The place where a building or a settlement develops is called its site.
2022. It was Mary’s birthday party.
2023. She and her friends were waiting for Gurpreet to arrive so that Mary could cut the cake.
2024. At last Gurpreet arrived- tired, coughing and wheezing.
2025. She explained that the traffic jam was terrible.
2026. Mary’s mother Mrs.Thomas patted Gurpreet’s back and sighed, “Oof! The pollution in our city!”
2027. Prasad had recently come from his village.
2028. He asked, “Why do we have such traffic jams and such pollution in the cities?”
2029. The number of vehicles is increasing day by day due to the growing population in the cities”,
2030. Mary asked, “Then why are people coming to the cities?”
2031. Her mother replied, They come looking for jobs, better education and medical facilities.
2032. Mary further enquired, “If so many people keep coming to cities, where will all the people live?”
2033. Mr. Thomas said, “That is why you see so many slums and squatter settlements where people stay in congested and unhygienic conditions.
2034. Shortage of power and water supply are common problems in the cities”.
2035. Transhumance: It is a seasonal movement of people.
2036. People who rear animals move in search of new pastures according to changes in seasons.
2037. Prasad said, “Our villages may not have big cinema halls, well-equipped schools and good hospitals, but we have a lot of open spaces and fresh air to breathe in.
2038. When my grandfather was sick we had to rush him to the city hospital.”
2039. From the above conversation we can identify two different pictures of settlements – the rural and the urban settlements.
2040. The villages are rural settlements where people are engaged in activities like agriculture, fishing, forestry, crafts work and trading etc.
2041. Rural settlements can be compact or scattered.
2042. A compact settlement is a closely built area of dwellings, wherever flat land is available
2043. In a scattered settlement dwellings are spaced over an extensive area.
2044. This type of settlement is mostly found in hilly tracts, thick forests, and regions of extreme climate.
2045. In rural areas, people build houses to suit their environment.
2046. In regions of heavy rainfall, they have slanting roofs.
2047. Places where water accumulates in the rainy season the houses are constructed on a raised platform or stilts
2048. Thick mud walled houses with thatched roofs are very common in areas of hot climate
2049. Local materials like stones, mud, clay, straw etc are used to construct houses.
2050. The towns are small and the cities are larger urban settlements.
2051. In urban areas the people are engaged in manufacturing, trading, and services.
2052. Name some of the villages, towns and cities of your state.
2053. Transport is the means by which people and goods move.
2054. In the early days it took a great deal of time to travel long distances.
2055. People had to walk and used animals to carry their goods. Invention of the wheel made transport easier.
2056. Invention of the wheel made transport easier.
2057. With the passage of time different means of transport developed but even today people use animals for transport
2058. In our country donkeys, mules, bullocks and camels are common.
2059. In the Andes Mountains of South America, llamas are used, as are yaks in Tibet.
2060. The early traders from other countries used to take several months to reach India.
2061. They took either the sea route or the land route.
2062. Aeroplanes have made travel faster.
2063. Now it takes only 6-8 hours to travel from India to Europe.
2064. Modern means of transport thus saves time and energy.
2065. List the different modes of transport used by the students of your class while coming to school.
2066. The most commonly used means of transport especially for short distances are roads.
2067. They can be metalled (pucca) and unmetalled (kutcha) and the plains have a dense network of roads.
2068. Roads have also been built in terrains like चचच, forests and even high mountains.
2069. Manali-Leh highway in the Himalayan Mountains is one of the highest roadways in the world.
2070. Roads built underground are called subways/under paths.
2071. Flyovers are built over raised structures.
2072. There are several National and State highways in India.
2073. The latest development in India is the construction of ExpressWays.
2074. The Golden Quadrilateral connects Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai and Kolkata.
2075. The railways carry heavy goods and people over long distances quickly and cheaply.
2076. The invention of the steam engine and the Industrial Revolution helped in speedy development of rail transport
2077. Diesel and electric engines have largely replaced the steam engines.
2078. In places super fast trains have been introduced to make the journey faster.
2079. The railway network is well developed over the plain areas.
2080. Advanced technological skills have enabled laying of railway lines in difficult mountain terrains also. But these are much fewer in number.
2081. The Indian railway network is well developed. 
2082. It is the largest in Asia.
2083. The train from Xining to Lhasa runs at an altitude of 4,000m above sea level and the highest point is 5,072 m
2084. The Trans-Siberian Railway is the longest railway system connecting St. Petersburg in Western Russia to Vladivostok on the Pacific coast.
2085. You have already learnt that since early days waterways were used for transportation.
2086. Waterways are the cheapest for carrying heavy and bulky goods over long distances.
2087. They are mainly of two types – inland waterways and sea routes.
2088. Navigable rivers and lakes are used as inland waterways.
2089. Some of the important inland waterways are the Ganga-Brahmaputra river system, the Great Lakes in North America and the river Nile in Africa.
2090. Sea routes and oceanic routes are mostly used for transporting merchandise and goods from one country to another.
2091. These routes are connected with the ports.
2092. Some of the important ports of the world are Singapore and Mumbai in Asia, New York, Los Angeles in North America, Rio de Janeiro in South America, Durban and Cape Town in Africa, Sydney in Australia, London and Rotterdam in Europe.
2093. Can you name some more ports of the world?
2094. This is the fastest way of transport developed in the early twentieth century.
2095. It is also the most expensive due to the high cost of fuels.
2096. Air traffic is adversely affected by bad weather like fog and storms.
2097. It is the only mode of transport to reach the most remote and distant areas especially where there are no roads and railways.
2098. Helicopters are extremely useful in most inaccessible areas and in times of calamities for rescuing people and distributing food, water, clothes and medicines.
2099. Some of the important airports are Delhi, Mumbai, New York, London, Paris, Frankfurt and Cairo.
2100. Communication is the process of conveying messages to others.
2101. With the development of technology humans have devised new and fast modes of communication.
2102. explains the evolution of the communication system.
2103. The advancement in the field of communication has brought about an information revolution in the world.
2104. Different modes of communication are used to provide information, to educate as well as to entertain.
2105. Through newspapers, radio and television we can communicate with a large number of people.
2106. They are therefore called mass media.
2107. The satellites have made communication even faster.
2108. Satellites have helped in oil exploration, survey of forest, underground water, mineral wealth,weather forecast and disaster warning.
2109. Now we can send electronic mails or emails through the Internet.
2110. Wireless telephonic communications through cellular phones have become very popular today.
2111. The Internet not only provides us with worldwide information and interaction but has also made our lives more comfortable.
2112. Now we can reserve tickets for railways, airways and even cinemas and hotels sitting at home. 
2113. With this kind of inter connectivity of people, services and institutions –across the world, we are a large global society.
2114. The people are a very important component of a country.
2115. India is the second most populous country after China in the world with its total population of 1,210 million (2011).
2116. India’s population is larger than the total population of North America, South America and Australia put together.
2117. More often, it is argued that such a large population invariably puts pressure on its limited resources and is also responsible for many socio-economic problems in the country.
2118. How do you perceive the idea of India?
2119. Is it simply a territory?
2120. Does this signify an amalgam of people?
2121. Is it a territory inhabited by people living under certain institutions of governance?
2122. In this chapter, we will discuss the patterns of distribution, density, growth and composition of India’s population.
2123. Population data are collected through Census operations held every 10 years in our country.
2124. The first population Census in India was conducted in 1872 but its first complete Census was conducted only in 1881.
2125. Examine Fig. 1.1 and try to describe the patterns of spatial distribution of population shown on it.
2126. It is clear that India has a highly uneven pattern of population distribution.
2127. The percentage shares of population of the states and Union Territories in the country show that Uttar Pradesh has the highest population followed by Maharashtra, Bihar and West Bengal.
2128. Looking at the data in Appendix , arrange the Indian States and Union Territories according to their sizes and population and find out :
2129. Check from the table (Appendix–iA) that U.P., Maharashtra, Bihar, West Bengal, Andhra Pradesh along with Tamil Nadu, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Karnataka and Gujarat, together account for about 76 per cent of the total population of the country.
2130. On the other hand, the share of population is very small in the states like Jammu & Kashmir (1.04%), Arunachal Pradesh (0.11%) and Uttarakhand (0.84%) in spite of these states having fairly large geographical areas.
2131. Such an uneven spatial distribution of population in India suggests a close relationship between population and physical, socio- economic and historical factors.
2132. As far as the physical factors are concerned, it is clear that climate along with terrain and availability of water largely determines the pattern of the population distribution.
2133. Consequently, we observe that the North Indian Plains, deltas and Coastal Plains have higher proportion of population than the interior districts of southern and central Indian States, Himalayas, some of the north eastern and the western states.
2134. However, development of irrigation (Rajasthan), availability of mineral and energy resources (Jharkhand) and development of transport network (Peninsular States) have resulted in moderate to high concentration of population in areas which were previously very thinly populated.
2135. Among the socio-economic and historical factors of distribution of population, important ones are evolution of settled agriculture and agricultural development; pattern of human settlement; development of transport network, industrialisation and urbanisation.
2136. It is observed that the regions falling in the river plains and coastal areas of India have remained the regions of larger population concentration.
2137. Even though the uses of natural resources like land and water in these regions have shown signs of degradation, the concentration of population remains high because of an early history of human settlement and development of transport networks.
2138. On the other hand, the urban regions of Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata, Bengaluru, Pune, Ahmedabad, Chennai and Jaipur have high concentration of population due to industrial development and urbanisation drawing a large number of rural-urban migrants.
2139. Density of population is expressed as the number of persons per unit area.
2140. It helps in getting a better understanding of the spatial distribution of population in relation to land.
2141. The density of population in India (2011) is 382 persons per sq km. There has been a steady increase of more than 200 persons per sq km over the last 50 years as the density of population increased from 117 persons/ sq km in 1951 to 382 persons/sq km in 2011.
2142. The data shown in Appendix (i) give an idea of spatial variation of population densities in the country which ranges from as low as 17 persons per sq km in Arunachal Pradesh to 11,297 persons in the National Capital Territory of Delhi.
2143. Among the northern Indian States, Bihar (1102), West Bengal (1029) and and Uttar Pradesh (828) have higher densities, while Kerala (859) and Tamil Nadu (555) have higher densities among the peninsular Indian states. States like Assam, Gujarat, Andhra Pradesh, Haryana, Jharkhand, Odisha have moderate densities.
2144. The hill states of the Himalayan region and North eastern states of India (excluding Assam) have relatively low densities while the Union Territories (excluding Andaman and Nicobar islands) have very high densities of population.
2145. The density of population, as discussed in the earlier paragraph, is a crude measure of human and land relationship.
2146. To get a better insight into the human-land ratio in terms of pressure of population on total cultivable land, the physiological and the agricultural densities should be found out which are significant for a country like India having a large agricultural population.
2147. Growth of population is the change in the number of people living in a particular area between two points of time.
2148. Its rate is expressed in percentage.
2149. Population growth has two components namely; natural and induced.
2150. While natural growth is analysed by assessing the crude birth and death rates, the induced components are explained by the volume of inward and outward movement of people in any given area.
2151. However, in the present chapter, we will only discuss the natural growth of India’s population.
2152. The decadal and annual growth rates of population in India are both very high and steadily increasing over time.
2153. The annual growth rate of India’s population is 1.64 percent (2011).
2154. Population doubling time is the time taken by any population to double itself at its current annual growth rate.
2155. The growth rate of population in India over the last one century has been caused by annual birth rate and death rate and rate of migration and thereby shows different trends.
2156. The period from 1901-1921 is referred to as a period of stagnant or stationary phase of growth of India’s population, since in this period growth rate was very low, even recording a negative growth rate during 1911-1921.
2157. Both the birth rate and death rate were high keeping the rate of increase low .
2158. Poor health and medical services, illiteracy of people at large and inefficient distribution system of food and other basic necessities were largely responsible for high birth and death rates in this period.
2159. The decades 1921-1951 are referred to as the period of steady population growth.
2160. An overall improvement in health and sanitation throughout the country brought down the mortality rate.
2161. At the same time, a better transport and communication system improved the distribution system.
2162. The crude birth rate remained high in this period leading to higher growth rate than the previous phase.
2163. This is impressive at the backdrop of the Great Economic Depression, 1920s and World War II.
2164. The decades 1951-1981 are referred to as the period of population explosion in India.
2165. which was caused by a rapid fall in the mortality rate but a high fertility rate of population in the country.
2166. The average annual growth rate was as high as 2.2 percent.
2167. It is in this period, after the Independence, that developmental activities were introduced through a centralised planning process.
2168. The economy started showing up ensuring the improvement of living conditions of people at large.
2169. Consequently, there was a high natural increase and higher growth rate.
2170. Besides, increased international migration bringing in Tibetans, Bangladeshis, Nepalies and even people from Pakistan contributed to the high growth rate.
2171. In the post 1981 till present, the growth rate of the country's population though remained high, has started slowing down gradually (Table 1.1).A downward trend of crude birth rate is held responsible for such a population growth.
2172. This was, in turn, affected by an increase in the mean age at marriage, improved quality of life particularly education of females in the country.
2173. The growth rate of population is, however, still high in the country, and it has been projected by the World Development Report that population of India will touch 1,350 million by 2025.
2174. The analysis done so far shows the average growth rate, but the country also has wide variation (Appendix–iv) in growth rates from one area to another which is discussed below.
2175. The growth rate of population during 1991- 2001 in Indian States and Union Territories shows a very obvious pattern.
2176. The States like Kerala, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Odisha, Puducherry, and Goa show a low rate of growth not exceeding 20 per cent over the decade.
2177. Kerala registered the lowest growth rate (9.4) not only in this group of states but also in the country as a whole.
2178. A continuous belt of states from west to east in the north-west, north, and north central parts of the country has relatively higher growth rate than the southern states.
2179. It is in this belt comprising Gujarat, Maharashtra, Rajasthan, Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Madhya Pradesh, Sikkim, Assam, West Bengal, Bihar, Chhattisgarh, and Jharkhand, the growth rate on the average remained 20-25 per cent.
2180. During 2001-2011, the growth rates of almost all States and Union Territories have registered a lower figure compared to the previous decade, namely, 1991-2001.
2181. During colonial period (British period) millions of the indentured labourers were sent to Mauritius, Caribbean islands (Trinidad, Tobago and Guyana), Fiji and South Africa by British from Uttar Pradesh and Bihar; to Reunion Island, Guadeloupe, Martinique and Surinam by French and Dutch and by Portuguese from Goa, Daman and Diu to Angola, Mozambique to work as plantation workers.
2182. All such migrations were covered under the time-bound contract known as Girmit Act (Indian Emigration Act). However, the living conditions of these indentured labourers were not better than the slaves.
2183. However, the living conditions of these indentured labourers were not better than the slaves.
2184. The second wave of migrants ventured out into the neighbouring countries in recent times as professionals, artisans, traders and factory workers, in search of economic opportunities to Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia, Brunei and African countries, etc. and the trend still continues.
2185. There was a steady outflow of India’s semi-skilled and skilled labour in the wake of the oil boom in West Asia in the 1970s.
2186. There was also some outflow of entrepreneurs, storeowners, professionals, businessmen to Western Countries.
2187. Third wave of migrants was comprised professionals like doctors, engineers (1960s onwards), software engineers, management consultants, financial experts, media persons (1980s onwards), and others migrated to countries such as USA, Canada, UK, Australia, New Zealand and Germany, etc.
2188. These professionals enjoy the distinction of being one of highly educated, the highest earning and prospering groups.
2189. After liberalisation, in the 90s education and knowledge–based Indian emigration has made the Indian Diaspora one of the most powerful diasporas in the world.
2190. In all these countries, Indian diaspora has been playing an important role in the development of the respective countries.
2191. You are familiar with Census in India.
2192. It contains information about migration in the country.
2193. Actually migration was recorded beginning from the first Census of India conducted in 1881.
2194. This data was recorded on the basis of place of birth.
2195. However, the first major modification was introduced in 1961 Census by bringing in two additional components viz; place of birth i.e. village or town and duration of residence (if born elsewhere).
2196. Further in 1971, additional information on place of last residence and duration of stay at the place of enumeration were incorporated.
2197. Information on reasons for migration were incorporated in 1981 Census and modified in consecutive Censuses.
2198. In the Census the following questions are asked on migration :
2199. Is the person born in this village or town?
2200. If no, then further information is taken on rural/urban status of the place of birth, name of district and state
2201. Has the person come to this village or town from elsewhere?
2202. If yes, then further questions are asked about the status (rural/urban) of previous place of residence, name of district and state and if outside India then name of the country.
2203. In addition, reasons for migration from the place of last residence and duration of residence in place of enumeration are also asked.
2204. In the Census of India migration is enumerated on two bases :
2205. place of birth, if the place of birth is different from the place of enumeration (known as life-time migrant);
2206. place of residence, if the place of last residence is different from the place of enumeration (known as migrant by place of last residence)."
2207. As per 2011 census, out of 1,210 million people in the country, 455.8 million (about 37%) were reported as migrants of place of last residence.
2208. A few facts pertaining to the internal migration (within the country) and international migration (out of the country and into the country from other countries) are presented here.
2209. "Under the internal migration, four streams are identified: (a)rural to rural (R-R); (b) rural to urban (R-U); (c) urban to urban (U-U); and (d) urban to rural
2210. (U-R)."
2211. In India, during 2011, out of 455.0 million migrants, enumerated on the basis of the last residence, 141.9 million had changed their place of residence in the last ten years.
2212. Out of these, 118.7 million were intra-state migrants.
2213. The stream was dominated by female migrants.
2214. Most of these were migrants related to marriage.
2215. The distribution of male and female migrants in different streams of intra-state and inter-state migration is presented in Fig. 2.1 a and 2.1 b.
2216. It is clearly evident that females predominate the streams of short distance rural to rural migration in both types of migration.
2217. Contrary to this, men predominate the rural to urban stream of inter-state migration due to economic reasons.
2218. Apart from these streams of internal migration, India also experiences immigration from and emigration to the neighbouring countries.
2219. Table 2.1 presents the details of migrants from neighbouring countries.
2220. Indian Census 2011 has recorded that more than 5 million person have migrated to India from other countries.
2221. Out of these, about 88.9 percent came from the neighbouring countries: Bangladesh followed by Nepal and Pakistan.
2222. Why are the numbers of females migrating from rural to rural areas in both the diagrams higher?
2223. Why is inter-state male migration higher from rural to urban?
2224. Better opportunities for education, better health facilities and sources of entertainment, etc., are also quite important pull factors.
2225. Examine the reasons for migration for males and females separately in Fig. 2.2.
2226. On the basis of the figures, it can be seen that the reasons for migration of males and females are different.
2227. For example, work and employment have remained the main cause for male migration (26 per cent) while it is only 2.3 percent for the females.
2228. Contrary to this, about 67 percent of females move out from their parental houses following their marriage.
2229. This is the most important cause in the rural areas of India except in Meghalaya where reverse is the case.
2230. Why is the female marriage migration law in Meghalaya different?
2231. In comparison to these marriages, migration of the male, is only 4 per cent in the country.
2232. Migration is a response to the uneven distribution of opportunities over space.
2233. People tend to move from a place of low opportunity and low safety to a place of higher opportunity and better safety.
2234. This, in turn, creates both benefits and problems for the areas, people migrate from and migrate to.
2235. Consequences can be observed in economic, social, cultural, political and demographic terms.
2236. A major benefit for the source region is the remittance sent by migrants.
2237. Remittances from international migrants are one of the major sources of foreign exchange.
2238. Punjab, Kerala and Tamil Nadu receive a very significant amount from their international migrants.
2239. The amount of remittances sent by the internal migrants is very meagre as compared to international migrants, but it plays an important role in the growth of the economy of the source area.
2240. Remittances are mainly used for food, repayment of debts, treatment, marriages, children’s education, agricultural inputs, construction of houses, etc.
2241. For thousands of the poor villages of Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Odisha, Andhra Pradesh,Himachal Pradesh etc. remittance works as life blood for their economy.
2242. Migration from rural areas of Eastern Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Madhya Pradesh and Odisha to rural areas of Punjab, Haryana,Western Uttar Pradesh accounted for the success of their green revolution strategy for agricultural development.
2243. Besides this,unregulated migration to metropolitan cities of India has caused overcrowding.
2244. Development of slums in industrially developed states such as Maharashtra, Gujarat, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and Delhi is a negative consequence of unregulated migration within the country.
2245. Can you name some other positive and negative consequences of migration?
2246. Migration leads to the redistribution of the population within a country.
2247. Rural urban migration is one of the important factors contributing to the population growth of cities.
2248. Age and skill selective migration from the rural area have adverse effects on the rural demographic structure.
2249. However, high out migration from Uttarakhand, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Eastern Maharashtra have brought serious imbalances in age and sex composition in these states.
2250. Similar imbalances are also brought in the recipient's states.
2251. What is cause of imbalance in sex ratio in the place of origin and destination of migrants?
2252. Migrants act as agents of social change.
2253. New ideas related to new technologies, family planning, girl’s education etc. get diffused from urban to rural areas through them.
2254. Migration leads to intermixing of people from diverse cultures.
2255. It has positive contributions such as evolution of composite culture and breaking through narrow considerations and widens up the mental horizon of people at large.
2256. But it also has serious negative consequences such as anonymity, which creates a social vacuum and sense of dejection among individuals.
2257. Continued feelings of dejection may motivate people to fall into the trap of anti-social activities like crime and drug abuse.
2258. Overcrowding of people due to rural-urban migration has put pressure on existing social and physical infrastructure in urban areas.
2259. This ultimately leads to unplanned growth of urban settlement and formation of slums shanty colonies.
2260. Apart from this, due to over-exploitation of natural resources, cities are facing acute problems of depletion of groundwater, air pollution, disposal of sewage and management of solid wastes.
2261. Others Migration (even excluding the marriage migration) affects the status of women directly or indirectly.
2262. In rural areas, male selective out migration leaving their wives behind puts extra physical as well mental pressure on women.
2263. Migration of ‘women’ either for education or employment enhances their autonomy and role in the economy.
2264. If remittances are major benefits of migration from the point of view of the source region,loss of human resources, particularly highly skilled people is the most serious cost.
2265. The market for advanced skills has become truly a global market and most dynamic industrial economies are admitting and recruiting significant proportions of highly trained professionals from poor regions.
2266. Consequently, the existing underdevelopment in the source region gets reinforced.
2267. Choose the right answers of the following from the given options
2268. Which one of the following is the main reason for male migration in India?
2269. Which one of the following states receives the maximum number of immigrants?
2270. Which one of the following streams is the main reason for female migration in India?
2271. Answer the following questions in about 30 words.
2272. Differentiate between life-time migrant and migrant by last residence.
2273. Identify the main reason for male/female selective migration.
2274. What is the impact of rural-urban migration on the age and sex structure of the place of origin and destination?
2275. About the place of origin and destination?
2276. Answer the following questions in about 150 words.
2277. Discuss the consequences of international migration in India.
2278. What are the socio demographic consequences of migration?
2279. It is often called the western or euro-centric view of development.
2280. For a postcolonial country like India, colonisation,marginalisation, social discrimination and regional disparity, etc. show the other face of development.
2281. Thus, for India, development is a mixed bag of opportunities as well as neglect and deprivations.
2282. There are a few areas like the metropolitan centres and other developed enclaves that have all the modern facilities available to a small section of its population.
2283. At the other extreme of it, there are large rural areas and the slums in the urban areas.
2284. that do not have basic amenities like potable water, education and health infrastructure available to the majority of this population.
2285. The situation is more alarming if one looks at the distribution of the development opportunities among different sections of our society.
2286. It is a well- established fact that the majority of the scheduled castes, scheduled tribes, landless agricultural labourers, poor farmers and slums dwellers etc. are the most marginalised lot.
2287. A large segment of the female population is the worst sufferers among all.
2288. It is also equally true that the relative as well as absolute conditions of the majority of these marginalised sections have worsened.
2289. Consequently, the vast majority of people are compelled to live under abject poverty and subhuman conditions.
2290. There is yet another inter-related aspect of development that has direct bearings on the deteriorating human conditions.
2291. It pertains to the environmental pollution leading to ecological crisis.
2292. Air, soil, water and noise pollution have not only led to the ‘tragedy of commons’.
2293. but these have also threatened the existence of our society.
2294. Consequently, the poor are being subjected to three interrelated processes of declining capabilities
2295. social capabilities – due to displacement and weakening social ties (social capital),
2296. environmental capabilities – due to pollution and,
2297. personal capabilities – due to increasing incidence of diseases and accidents.
2298. This, in turn, has adverse effects on their quality of life and human development.
2299. Based on the above experiences, it can be said that the present development has not been able to address the issues of social injustice, regional imbalances and environmental degradation.
2300. On the contrary, it is being widely considered as the prime cause of the social distributive injustices, deterioration in the quality of life and human development.
2301. Does development create, reinforce and perpetuate these crises?
2302. the prevalent western views of development which considers development as the remedy to all the ills
2303. Thus, it was thought to take up human development as a separate issue against the prevalent western views of development ,Concerted efforts were made to look at development critically at various times in the past.
2304. But, the most systematic effort towards this was the publication of the First Human Development Report by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) in 1990.
2305. Since then, this organisation has been bringing out the World Human Development Report every year.
2306. This report does not only define human development, makes amendments and changes its indicators.
2307. but also ranks all the countries of the world based on the calculated scores.
2308. According to the Human Development Report 1993, “progressive democratisation and increasing empowerment What is Human Development?
2309. “Human development is a process of enlarging the range of people’s choices,covering the full range of human choices from a sound physical environment to economic, social and political freedom.”increasing the opportunities of people for education, health care, income and empowerment.
2310. Thus, enlarging the range of people’s choices is the most significant aspect of human development.
2311. People’s choices may involve a host of other issues, but, living a long and healthy life, to be educated and have access to resources needed for a decent standard of living including political freedom
2312. guaranteed human rights and personal self-respect, etc. are considered some of the non-negotiable aspects of human development.
2313. increasing empowerment of people are seen as the minimum conditions for human development.
2314. Moreover, it also mentions that “development must be woven around people, not the people around development” as was the case previously.
2315. You have studied the book, “Fundamentals of Human Geography.” approaches to human development and methods of calculating the index in your book, You have already studied the concepts, indicators.
2316. let us try to understand the applicability of these concepts and indicators to India.
2317. India with a population of over 1.20 billion is ranked 130 among 189 countries of the world in terms of the Human Development Index With the composite HDI value of 0.640 India finds herself grouped with countries showing medium human development.
2318. Low scores in the HDI is a matter of serious concern but some reservations have been expressed about the approach as well as indicators selected to calculate the index values and ranking of the states/countries.
2319. Lack of sensitivity to the historical factors like discrimination on the basis ofrace, religion, gender and caste, social problems like crimes, terrorism, and war and political factors like nature of the state, forms of the government level of empowerment are some factors that are very crucial in determining the nature of human development.
2320. These aspects have special significance in the case of India and many other developing countries.
2321. Using the indicators selected by the UNDP, the Planning Commission of India also prepared the Human Development Report for India.
2322. It used states and the Union Territories as the units of analysis.
2323. Subsequently, each state government also started preparing the state level Human Development Reports, using districts as the units of analysis.
2324. Although, the final HDI by the Planning Commission of India has been calculated by taking the three indicators as discussed in the book entitled, Fundamentals of Human Geography.
2325. This report also discussed other indicators like economic attainment, social empowerment, social distributive justice, accessibility, hygiene and various welfare measures undertaken by the state.
2326. Some of the important indicators have been discussed in the following pages.
2327. Rich resource base and access to these resources by all, particularly the poor, downtrodden and the marginalised is the key to productivity, well-being and human development.
2328. Gross National Product (GNP) and its per capita availability are taken as measures to assess the resource base/endowment of any country.
2329. Economic attainment and the well-being of individuals depend on economic growth, employment opportunities and access to assets.
2330. Over the years the per capita income and consumption expenditure in India has increased.
2331. As a result there has been a consistent decline in the proportion of the population living below the poverty line.
2332. The percentage of persons below the poverty line in 2011-12 has been estimated as 25.7% in rural areas, 13.7% in urban areas and 21.9% for the country as a whole.
2333. The data of poverty for the states show that there are States like Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Manipur, Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Bihar, Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh, Manipur and Odissi, Dadra and Nagar Haveli which have recorded more than 30 percent of their population living below the poverty line.
2334. Other states like Gujarat, Haryana, Jammu and Kashmir, Maharashtra, Meghalaya, Nagaland Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu, Tripura, Uttarakhand and West-Bengal have recorded between 10 to 20 percent of their population below poverty line.
2335. Andhra Pradesh, Delhi, Goa, Himachal Pradesh, Kerala, Punjab, Sikkim, Puducherry, Andaman and Nicobar Islands, Daman and Diu, Lakshadweep have below 10 percent of their population living below poverty line.
2336. Poverty is a state of deprivation.
2337. In absolute terms it reflects the inability of an individual to satisfy certain basic needs for a sustained, healthy and reasonably productive living.
2338. The Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of a country does not fully reflect the quality of life of a country."
2339. There are other factors like housing, access to public transport, air, quality and access to drinking water which also determine the standard of living.
2340. Jobless growth and rampant unemployment are some of the important reasons for higher incidences of poverty in India.
2341. Life free from illness and ailment and living a reasonably long life span are indicative of a healthy life.
2342. Availability of pre and post natal healthcare facilities in order to reduce infant mortality and post delivery deaths among mothers, old age health care, adequate nutrition and safety of individual are some important measures of a healthy and reasonably long life
2343. Swachh Bharat Mission (SBM)
2344. The release of toxic and non-biodegradable wastes from industries and urban sewerages, and open defecation, etc, have created many health hazards.
2345. The Government of India has initiated many steps to address these problems and the Swachh Bharat Mission is one of these.
2346. A healthy mind lives in a healthy body
2347. and for a healthy body, clean environment, particularly, clean air, water, noise-free ambience and hygienic surroundings are prerequisites.
2348. Municipal waste, industrial effluents and pollutants generated by transport, etc., are major sources of pollution in urban India.
2349. Open defecation in rural areas and in urban slums are a major source of pollution.
2350. The Government of India with its flagship programme Swachh Bharat Mission (SBM) aims at a pollution-free environment. Its objectives are:
2351. making India open defecation-free and achieving 100 per cent scientific management of municipal solid waste, construction of individual household latrines (IHHL), community toilet (CT) seats and public toilet (PT) seats;
2352. making provisions for the supply of clean energy fuel LPG to all households in rural India to reduce domestic pollution;
2353. providing potable drinking water to every household to control the spread of water-borne diseases; and
2354. promoting the use of non-conventional energy resources, like wind and solar energy.
2355. Economically developed states like Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu and Punjab and Haryana have higher value of HDI as compared to states like Chhattisgarh, Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, etc.
2356. Regional distortions and social disparities which developed during the colonial period continue to play an important role in the Indian economy, polity and society.
2357. The Government of India has made concerted efforts to institutionalise balanced development with its main focus on social distributive justice through planned development.
2358. It has made significant achievements in most of the fields but these are still below the desired level.
2359. Development in general and human development in particular is a complex concept used in social sciences.
2360. It is complex because for ages it was thought that development is a substantive concept and once it is achieved it will address all the socio-cultural and environmental ills of the society
2361. Though, development has brought in significant improvement in the quality of life in more than one way but increasing regional disparities, social inequalities, discriminations, deprivations, displacement of people, abuse of human rights and undermining human values and environmental degradation have also increased.
2362. Considering the gravity and sensitivity of the issues involved, the UNDP in its Human Development Report 1993, tried to amend some of the implicit biases and prejudices which were entrenched in the concept of development.
2363. People’s participation and their security were the major issues in the Human Development Report of 1993.
2364. It also emphasised on progressive democratisation and increasing empowerment of people as minimum conditions for human development.
2365. The report recognised the greater constructive role of ‘Civil Societies’ in bringing about peace and human development.
2366. The civil society should work for building up an opinion for reduction in the military expenditure, demobilisation of armed forces, transition from defence to production of basic goods and services and particularly disarmament and reduction in the nuclear warheads by the developed countries.
2367. In a nuclearised world, peace and well-being are major global concerns.
2368. At the other extreme of this approach lie the views expressed by the Neo-Malthusians, environmentalists and radical ecologists.
2369. They believe that for a happy and peaceful social life proper balance between population and resources is a necessary condition.
2370. According to these thinkers, the gap between the resources and population has widened after the eighteenth century.
2371. There has been marginal expansion in the resources of the world in the last three hundred years but there has been phenomenal growth in the human population.
2372. Development has only contributed in increasing the multiple uses of the limited resources of the world while there has been enormous increase in the demand for these resources.
2373. Therefore, the prime task before any development activity is to maintain parity between population and resources.
2374. Scholar like Sir Robert Malthus was the first one to voice his concern about the growing scarcity of resources as compared to the human population.
2375. Apparently this argument looks logical and convincing, but a critical look will reveal certain intrinsic flaws such as resources are not a neutral category.
2376. It is not the availability of resources that is as important as their social distribution.
2377. Resources everywhere are unevenly distributed.
2378. Rich countries and people have access to large resource baskets while the poor find their resources shrinking.
2379. Moreover, unending pursuit for the control of more and more resources by the powerful and use of the same for exhibiting one's prowess is the prime cause of conflicts as well as the apparent contradictions between population resource and development.
2380. Indian culture and civilization have been very sensitive to the issues of population, resource and development for a long time.
2381. It would not be incorrect to say that the ancient scriptures were essentially concerned about the balance and harmony among the elements of nature.
2382. Mahatma Gandhi in recent times advocated the reinforcement of the harmony and balance between the two.
2383. He was quite apprehensive about the on-going development particularly the way industrialisation has institutionalised the loss of morality, spirituality, self-reliance, nonviolence and mutual co-operation and environment.
2384. In his opinion, austerity for individuals, trusteeship of social wealth and nonviolence are the key to attain higher goals in the life of an individual as well as that of a nation.
2385. His views were also re-echoed in the Club of Rome Report “Limits to Growth” (1972), Schumacher’s book “Small is Beautiful” (1974), Brundtland Commission’s Report “Our Common Future” (1987) and finally in the “Agenda-21 Report of the Rio Conference” (1993).
2386. Choose the right answers of the following from the given options.

2390. Which one of the following states of India has the lowest female child sex ratio 0-6 years?
2391. Which one of the following Union Territories of India has the highest literacy rate?
2392. Answer the following questions in about 30 words.
2393. Define Human Development.
2394. Give two reasons for low levels of Human Development in most of the Northern States of India.
2395. Give two reasons for declining child sex ratio in India.
2396. Answer the following questions in about 150 words.
2397. Discuss the spatial patterns of female literacy in India in 2011 and bring out the reasons responsible for it.
2398. Which factors have caused spatial variations in the levels of Human Development among the states in India?
2399. Case Study - Integrated Tribal Development Project in Bharmour Region.
2400. Bharmour tribal area comprises Bharmour and Holi tehsils of Chamba district of Himachal pradesh.
2401. It has been a notified tribal area since 21 November 1975.
2402. Bharmour is inhabited by ‘Gaddi’, a tribal community who have maintained a distinct identity in the Himalayan region as they practised transhumance and conversed through Gaddiali dialect.
2403. Bharmour tribal region has harsh climate conditions, low resource base and fragile environment.
2404. These factors have influenced the society and Economy of the region.
2405. According to the 2011 census, the total population of Bharmour sub-division was 39,113 i.e., 21 persons per sq km.
2406. It is one of the most (economically and socially) backward areas of Himachal Pradesh.
2407. Historically, the Gaddis have experienced geographical and political isolation and socio-economic deprivation.
2408. The economy is largely based on agriculture and allied activities such as sheep and goat rearing.
2409. The process of development of the tribal area of Bharmaur started in the 1970s when Gaddis were included among ‘scheduled tribes’.
2410. Under the Fifth Five Year Plan, the tribal sub-plan was introduced in 1974 and Bharmauur was designated as one of the five Integrated Tribal Development Projects (ITDP) in Himachal Pradesh.
2411. This area development plan was aimed at improving the quality of life of the Gaddis and narrowing the gap in the level of development between Bharmaur and other areas of Himachal Pradesh.
2412. This plan laid the highest priority on development of transport and communications, agriculture and allied activities, and social and community services.
2413. The most significant contribution of tribal sub-plan in Bharmaur region is the development of infrastructure in terms of schools, healthcare facilities, potable water, roads, communications and electricity.
2414. But the villages located along the river Ravi in Holi and Khani areas are the main beneficiaries of infrastructural development.
2415. The remote villages in Tundah and Kugti areas still do not have sufficient infrastructure.
2416. The social benefits derived from ITDP include tremendous increase in literacy rate, improvement in sex ratio and decline in child marriage.
2417. The female literacy rate in the region increased from 1.88 per cent in 1971 to 65 per cent in 2011.
2418.  The difference between males and females in literacy level i.e. gender inequality, has also declined.
2419. Traditionally, the Gaddis had subsistence agricultural-cum-pastoral economy having emphasis on food grains and livestock production.
2420. But during the last three decades of twentieth century, the cultivation of pulses and other cash crops has increased in Bharmaur region.
2421. But the crop cultivation is still done with traditional technology. 
2422. The declining importance of pastoralism in the economy of the region can be gauged from the fact that at present only about one-tenth of the total households practise transhumance
2423. But the Gaddis are still very mobile as a sizable section of them migrate to Kangra and surrounding areas during winter to earn their livings from wage labour..
2424. The term development is generally used to describe the state of particular societies and the process of changes experienced by them.
2425. During a fairly large period of human history, the state of societies has largely been determined by the interaction processes between human societies and their biophysical environment.
2426. The processes of human - environment interaction depend upon the level of technology and institutions nurtured by a society.
2427. While the technology and institutions have helped in increasing the pace of human environment interaction, the momentum thus, generated in return has accelerated technological progress and transformation and creation of institutions
2428. Hence, development is a multi-dimensional concept and signifies the positive, irreversible transformation of the economy, society and environment.
2429. The concept of development is dynamic and has evolved during the second half of the twentieth century.
2430. In the post World War II era, the concept of development was synonymous to economic growth which is measured in terms of temporal increase in gross national product (GNP) and per capita income/per capita consumption.
2431. But, even the countries having high economic growth, experienced a speedy rise in poverty because of its unequal distribution.
2432. So, in the 1970s, the phrases such as redistribution with growth and growth and equity were incorporated in the definition of development.
2433. While dealing with the questions related to redistribution and equity, it was realised that the concept of development cannot be restricted to the economic sphere alone.
2434. It also includes the issues such as improving the well-being and living standard of people, availing of the health, education and equality of opportunity and ensuring political and civil rights.
2435. By the 1980s, development emerged as a concept encapsulating wide-spread improvement in social as well as material well being of all in a society.
2436. The notion of sustainable development emerged in the wake of a general rise in the awareness of environmental issues in the late 1960s in Western World.
2437. It reflected the concern of people about undesirable effects of industrial development on the environment.
2438. The publication of ‘The Population Bomb’ by Ehrlich in 1968 and ‘The Limits to Growth’ by Meadows and others in 1972 further raised the level of fear among environmentalists in particular and people in general.
2439. This sets the scenario for the emergence of new models of development under a broad phrase ‘sustainable development.’
2440. Choose the right answers of the following from the given options.
2441. Regional planning relates to :
2442. Development of various sectors of economy.

2456. Assess the impact of such programmes on the society and economy in your locality.
2457. Select your own area or identify an area facing severe environmental and socio-economic problems.
2458. Make an assessment of its resources and prepare their inventory.
2459. Suggest the measures for its sustainable development as it has been done in the case of Indira Gandhi Canal Command Area.
2460. Transport and communication.
2461. We use many items in our daily life.
2462. From toothpaste to our bed tea, milk, clothes, soaps, food items, etc., are required every day.
2463. All these can be purchased from the market.
2464. Have you ever thought as to how these items are brought from the site of production?
2465. All the production is meant for consumption.
2466. From the fields and factory, the produce is brought to the place from where consumers purchase it.
2467. It is the transportation of these items from the site of their production to the market which makes them available to the consumer.
2468. We not only use material things, like fruits, vegetables, books, clothes, etc., but also use ideas, views and messages in our daily life.
2469. Do you know we exchange our views, ideas and messages from one place to another or one individual to another while communicating with the help of various means.
2470. The use of transport and communication depends upon our need to move things from place of their availability to the place of their use.
2471. Human beings use various methods to move goods, commodities, and ideas from one place to another.
2472. The following diagram shows the major means of transportation.
2473. The pathways and unmetalled roads have been used for transportation in India since ancient times.
2474. With the economic and technological development, metalled roads and railways were developed to move large volumes of goods and people from one place to another.
2475. India has one of the second largest road networks in the world.
2476. It has a total length of about 56 lakh km.
2477. About 85 percent of passenger and 70 percent of freight traffic are carried by roads every year.
2478. Road transport is relatively suitable for shorter distance travel.
2479. Do you know?
2480. Sher Shah Suri built the Shahi (Royal) road to strengthen and consolidate his empire from the Indus Valley to the Sonar Valley in Bengal.
2481. This road was renamed the Grand Trunk (GT) road during the British period, connecting Calcutta and Peshawar.
2482. At present, it extends from Amritsar to Kolkata and it is bifurcated into 2 segments.
2483. Road transport in the modern sense was very limited in India before World War-II.
2484. The first serious attempt was made in 1943 when 'Nagpur Plan' was drawn.
2485. This plan could not be implemented due to lack of coordination among the princely states and British India.
2486. After Independence, a twenty-year road plan (1961) was introduced to improve the conditions of roads in India.
2487. However, roads continue to concentrate in and around urban centres.
2488. Rural and remote areas had the least connectivity by road.
2489. For the purpose of construction and maintenance, roads are classified as National Highways (NH), State Highways(SH).
2490. The main roads which are constructed and maintained by the Central Government are known as the National Highways.
2491. These roads are meant for inter-state transport and movement of defence men and material in strategic areas.
2492. These also connect the state capitals, major cities, important ports, railway junctions, etc.
2493. The length of the National Highways has increased from 19,700 km in 1951 to 101011 km in 2016,
2494. The National Highways constitute only about 2 percent of the total road length.
2495. But carry 40 per cent of the road traffic.
2496. The National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) was operationalised in 1995.
2497. It is an autonomous body under the Ministry of Surface Transport.
2498. It is entrusted with the responsibility of development, maintenance and operation of National Highways.
2499. This is also the apex body to improve the quality of the roads designated as National Highways.
2500. National HighwaysDevelopment Projects.
2501. Golden Quadrilateral comprises construction of 5,846 km long 4/6 lane, high density traffic corridor,
2502. to connect India's four big metro cities of Delhi-Mumbai-Chennai Kolkata.
2503. The North-South corridor aims at connecting.
2504. Srinagar in Jammu and Kashmir with Kanniyakuman in Tamil Nadu (including Kochchi-Salem Spur) with 4,076-km long road.
2505. The East West Corridor has been planned to connect Scharin Assam with the port town of Porbandar in Gujarat with 3,640-km of road length
2506. These are constructed and maintained by state governments. They join the state capitals with district headquarters and other important towns.
2507. These roads are connected to the National Highways.
2508. These constitute 4 per cent of total road length in the country.
2509. These roads are the connecting link between District Headquarters and the other important nodes in the district.
2510. They account for 14 per cent of the total road length of the country.
2511. These roads are vital for providing links in the rural areas.
2512. About 80 per cent of the total road length in India are categorised as rural roads.
2513. There is regional variation in the density of rural roads because these are influenced by the nature of the terrain.
2514. Why are the rural roads' density very low in hilly, plateau and forested areas?
2515. Why does the quality of rural roads deteriorate away from the urban centres?
2516. Other roads include Border Roads and International Highways.
2517. Choose the right answers of the following from the given options.

2533. India’s international trade has undergone a sea change in recent years in terms of volume, composition as well as direction.
2534. Although India’s contribution in world trade is as low as one per cent of the total volume, yet it plays a significant role in the world economy.
2535. Let us examine the changing pattern of India’s International trade. 
2536. In 1950-51, India’s external trade was worth Rs.1,214 crore, which rose to Rs. 44,29,762 crore in 2016-17.
2537. Can you calculate the percentage growth in 2016-17 over 1950-51?
2538. There are numerous reasons for this sharp rise in overseas trade, such as the momentum picked up by the manufacturing sectors, the liberal policies of the government and the diversification of markets.
2539. The nature of India’s foreign trade has changed over the years.
2540. Though there has been an increase in the total volume of import and export, the value of import continued to be higher than that of exports.
2541. Changing Pattern of the Composition of India’s Exports .
2542. Extent of gap between Exports and Imports in India’s foreign trade During 2012-13 to 2016-17.
2543. The composition of commodities in India's International trade has been undergoing a change over the years.
2544. The share of agriculture and allied products has declined, whereas, shares of petroleum and crude products and other commodities have increased.
2545. The shares of ore minerals and manufactured goods have largely remained constant over the years from 2009-10 to 2010-11and 2015-16 to 2016-17.
2546. The decline in traditional items is largely due to the tough international competition.
2547. Amongst the agricultural products, there is a decline in the export of traditional items, such as coffee, cashew, etc.
2548. Though an increase has been registered in floricultural products, fresh fruits, marine products and sugar, etc.
2549. Manufacturing sector alone accounted for 73.6 per cent of India’s total value of export in 2016-17.
2550. China and other East Asian countries are our major competitors.
2551. Gems and jewellery contribute a larger share of India’s foreign trade.
2552. Changing Patterns of the Composition of India’s Import.
2553. India faced serious food shortages during the 1950s and 1960s.
2554. The major item of import at that time was foodgrain, capital goods, machinery and equipment.
2555. The balance of payment was adverse as imports were more than export in spite of all the efforts of import substitution.
2556. After the 1970s, foodgrain import was discontinued due to the success of the Green revolution.
2557. But the energy crisis of 1973 pushed the prices of petroleum, and the import budget was also pushed up. 
2558. Foodgrain import was replaced by fertilisers and petroleum.
2559. Machine and equipment, special steel, edible oil and chemicals largely make the import basket.
2560. Examine the changing pattern of imports in Table 11.4 and try to comprehend the shifts.
2561. Table 11.4 shows that there is a steep rise in the import of petroleum products.
2562. It is used not only as a fuel but also as an industrial raw material.
2563. It indicates the tempo of rising industrialisation and better standard of living.
2564. Sporadic price rise in the international market is another reason for the same.
2565. Import of capital goods maintained a steady increase due to rising demand in the export-oriented industrial and domestic sectors.
2566. Non-electrical machinery, transport, equipment, manufacturers of metals and machine tools were the main items of capital goods.
2567. Import of food and allied products declined with a fall in imports of edible oils.
2568. Other major items of India’s import include pearls and semi-precious stones, gold and silver, metalliferous ores and metal scrap, non-ferrous metals, electronic goods, etc.
2569. The details of Indian imports of some principal commodities during 2016-17 have been given in Table 11.5.
2570. Based on table 11.5, few activities may be undertaken.
2571. Arrange the items in ascending or descending order and write the names of the first five major items of India’s import list of 2016-17.
2572. Why does India import edible oil in spite of being an agriculturally rich country? 
2573. Select five most important and five least important items and represent them by bar diagram.
2574. Can you identify some items of imports for which substitutes can be developed in India? 
2575. Karnataka is the major hinterland for this port.
2576. Kochchi Port, situated at the head of Vembanad Kayal, popularly known as the ‘Queen of the Arabian Sea’, is also a natural harbour.
2577. This port has an advantageous location being close to the Suez-Colombo route.
2578. It caters to the needs of Kerala, southern-Karnataka and south western Tamil Nadu.
2579. Kolkata Port is located on the Hugli river,128 km inland from the Bay of Bengal.
2580. Like the Mumbai port, this port was also developed by the British.
2581. Kolkata had the initial advantage of being the capital of British India.
2582. Kolkata port is also confronted with the problem of silt accumulation in the Hugli river which provides a link to the sea.
2583. Its hinterland covers U.P., Bihar, Jharkhand, West Bengal,Sikkim and the north-eastern states.
2584. Apart from this, it also extends ports facilities to our neighbouring land-locked countries such as Nepal and Bhutan.
2585. Haldia Port is located 105 km downstream from Kolkata.
2586. It has been constructed to reduce the congestion at Kolkata port.
2587. It handles bulk cargo like iron ore, coal,petroleum, petroleum products and fertilisers,jute, jute products, cotton and cotton yarn, etc.
2588. Paradip Port is situated in the Mahanadi delta, about 100 km from Cuttack.
2589. It has the deepest harbour specially suited to handle very large vessels.
2590. It has been developed mainly to handle large-scale export of iron-ore.
2591. Odisha, Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand are the parts of its hinterland.
2592. Visakhapatnam Port in Andhra Pradesh is a land-locked harbour, connected to the sea by a channel cut through solid rock and sand.
2593. An outer harbour has been developed for handling iron-ore, petroleum and general cargo.
2594. Andhra Pradesh and Telangana are the main hinterlands for this port.
2595. Chennai Port is one of the oldest ports on the eastern coast.
2596. It is not very suitable for large ships because of the shallow waters near the coast.
2597. Ennore, a newly developed port in TamilNadu, has been constructed 25 km north of Chennai to relieve the pressure at Chennai port.
2598. Tuticorin Port was also developed to relieve the pressure of Chennai port.
2599. It deals with a variety of cargo, including coal, salt, food grains, edible oils, sugar, chemicals and petroleum products.
2600. Air transport plays an important role in international trade.
2601. It is very costly and unsuitable for carrying heavy and bulky commodities.
2602. There were 25 major airports functioning in the country.
2603. Identify four cities where maximum number of air routes converge
2604. Trade between two countries is termed as ?
2605. Which one of the following is a land locked harbour?
2606. Most of India’s foreign trade is carried through .
2607. Mention the characteristics of India’s foreign trade.
2608. Explain the meaning of hinterland.
2609. Name the ports of India located on the east coast.
2610. Name important items which India imports from different countries.
2611. Describe the composition of export and import trade of India.
2612. Write a note on the changing nature of the international trade of India.
2613. Name the nearest domestic and international airports from your place.
2614. Identify the state with the maximum number of domestic airports.
2615. Water pollution is a source of various water- borne diseases.
2616. The diseases commonly caused due to contaminated water are diarrhoea, intestinal worms, hepatitis, etc.
2617. The World Health Organization shows that about one-fourth of the communicable diseases in India are water-borne.
2618. Though river pollution is common to all rivers, yet pollution of river Ganga flowing through one of the most populous regions of India has caused great concerns among all.
2619. To improve the condition of the river,the National Mission for Clean Ganga was initiated.
2620. The Namami Gange Programme has been launched for the same.
2621. Air pollution is taken as an addition of contaminants, like dust, fumes, gas, fog, odour, smoke or vapour to the air in substantial proportion and duration that may be harmful to flora and fauna and to property.
2622. With increasing use of varieties of fuels as the source of energy, there is a marked increase in emission of toxic gases into the atmosphere resulting in the pollution of air.
2623. Combustion of fossil fuels, mining and industries are the main sources of air pollution.
2624. These processes release oxides of sulphur and nitrogen,hydrocarbons, carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, lead and asbestos.
2625. Air pollution causes various diseases related to circulatory, nervous and respiratory systems.
2626. Smoky fog over cities called urban smog is caused by atmospheric pollution.
2627. It proves very harmful to human health.
2628. Air pollution can also cause acid rains
2629. Rainwater analysis of urban environments has indicated that pH value of the first rain after summer is always lower than the subsequent rains.
2630. Noise pollution refers to the state of unbearable and uncomfortable to human beings which is caused by noise from different sources.
2631. This matter has become a serious concern only in recent years due to a variety of technological innovations.
2632. The main sources of noise pollution are various factories, mechanised construction and demolition works, automobiles and aircraft, etc.
2633. There may be added periodical but polluting noise from sirens, loudspeakers used in various festivals, programmes associated with community activities.
2634. The level of steady noise is measured by sound level expressed in terms of decibels (dB).
2635. Of all these sources, the biggest nuisance is the noise produced by traffic.
2636. Its intensity and nature depend upon factors, such as the type of aircraft, vehicle, train and the condition of road, as well as that of vehicle.
2637. In sea traffic, the noise pollution is confined to the harbour due to loading and unloading activities being carried.
2638. Industries cause noise pollution but with varying intensity depending upon the type industry.
2639. Noise pollution is location specific and its intensity declines with increase in distance from the source of pollution, i.e. industrial areas, arteries of transportation, airports, etc.
2640. Noise pollution is hazardous in many metropolitan and big cities in India.
2641. Urban areas are generally marked by overcrowding, congestion, inadequate facilities to support the fast growing population and consequent poor sanitary conditions and foul air. 
2642. Environmental pollution by solid wastes has now got significance because of enormous growth in the quantity of wastes generated from various sources.
2643. Solid waste refers to a variety of old and used articles, for example stained small pieces of metals, broken glassware, plastic containers, polythene bags, ash, floppies, CDs, etc.,dumped at different places. 
2644. These discarded materials are also termed as refuse, garbage and rubbish, etc., and are disposed of from two sources :(i) household or domestic establishments, and (ii) industrial or commercial establishments. 
2645. In India, the population in cities is rapidly increasing.
2646. Due to low opportunities in smaller and medium cities, the poor people generally bypass these small cities and directly come to the megacities for their livelihood.
2647. A case study given below to have a better understanding of the subject.
2648. Read it carefully and try to comprehend the process of rural urban migration.
2649. Ramesh has been working in contract as a welder on a construction site in Talcher (coal region of Odisha) for the last two years.
2650. He moved with the contractor to various places like Surat, Mumbai, Gandhi Nagar, Bharuch, Jamnagar and so on.
2651. He remits Rs. 20,000 per year to his father in his native village.
2652. Part of the money is also used in agriculture, purchasing of land and building of houses, etc.
2653. The standard of living of Ramesh’s family improved significantly.
2654. Fifteen years ago, the situation was not the same.
2655. The family was passing through very tough times.
2656. Three of his brothers and their families had to survive on three acres of land.
2657. The family was highly in debt.
2658. Ramesh had to discontinue his studies after ninth standard.
2659. He was further hard pressed when he got married.
2660. Simultaneously, he was also impressed by some successful out-migrants of his village who had been working in Ludhiana and supporting their families in the village by sending money and some consumer goods.
2661. Thus, due to abject poverty in the family and perceived job promises at Ludhiana, he made a move to Punjab with his friend. 
2662. He worked there in a woolen factory for six months at the rate of only Rs. 20 per day in 1988.
2663. Apart from the crisis of managing his personal expenditure from this meagre income, he was also facing difficulty in assimilation to the new culture and environment.
2664. Then he decided to change his place of work from Ludhiana to Surat under the guidance of his friend.
2665. He learnt the skills of welding in Surat and after that he has been moving to different places with the same contractor.
2666. Though the economic condition of Ramesh‘s family at the village improved, he is bearing the pain of separation of his near and dear ones.
2667. He cannot shift them with him, as the job is temporary and transferable.
2668. Dharavi is part of central Bombay where three wheelers are banned.
2669. Only one main road traverses the slum.
2670. The miscalled ‘ninety-foot road’.
2671. which has been reduced to less than half of that for most of its length.
2672. Some of the side alleys and lanes are so narrow that not even a bicycle can pass.
2673. The whole neighbourhood consists of temporary buildings, two or three storeyed high with rusty iron stairways to the upper part, where a single room is rented by a whole family.
2674. Sometimes accommodating twelve or more people.
2675. This is a kind of tropical version of the industrial dwelling of Victorian London’s East End.
2676. But Dharavi is a keeper of more sombre secrets than the revulsion it inspires in the rich; a revulsion, moreover, that is, in direct proportion to the role it serves in the creation of the wealth of Bombay.
2677. In this place of shadowless, treeless sunlight, uncollected garbage, stagnant pools of foul water, where the only non-human creatures are the shining black crows and long grey rats, some of the most beautiful, valuable and useful articles in India are made.
2678. From Dharavi come delicate ceramics and pottery, exquisite embroidery and zari work, sophisticated leather goods, high-fashion garments, finely-wrought metalwork, delicate jewellery settings, wood carvings and furniture that would find its way into the richest houses, both in India and abroad.
2679. Dharavi was an arm of the sea that was filled by waste, largely produced by the people who have come to live there:: Scheduled Castes and poor Muslims.
2680. It comprises rambling buildings of corrugated metal, 20 metres high in places, used for the treatment of hides and tanning.
2681. There are pleasant parts, but rotting garbage is everywhere.
2682. In developing countries, poor, semi-illiterate and the unskilled like Ramesh migrating from rural areas frequently end up performing menial jobs at low wages in the informal sector in urban areas.
2683. Since wages are very low to support the family at the place of destination, the spouses are left behind in rural areas to look after children and elderly people.
2684. You have also learnt in the book entitled “Fundamentals of Human Geography” that this concept is defined differently in different countries.
2685. Both urban and rural settlements are different in their functions, sometimes,complementing each other.
2686. Apart from these, rural and urban areas have also emerged into two separate cultural, social, political, economic and technological divide.
2687. India, which has a predominance of rural population (approximately 69 per cent of the total population in 2011) and where villages were considered the ideal republics byMahatma Gandhi, most of the rural areas are still poor performing primary activities.
2688. Here most of the villages exist as an appendix to the core urban center forming its hinterland.
2689. This may give an impression that urban centers exist as undifferentiated homogeneous entities in opposition to the rural areas.
2690. At the top, there are farm houses and high income group localities characterized by well-developed urban infrastructures, like wide roads, streetlights, water and sanitation facilities, lawns, well-developed green belt, parks, playgrounds and provisions for individual security and right to privacy.
2691. At the other extreme of it are the slums, jhuggi-jhopri clusters and colonies of shanty structures.
2692. These are inhabited by those people who were forced to migrate from the rural areas to these urban centers in search of livelihood but could not afford proper housing due to high rent and high costs of land.
2693. Slums are residential areas of the least choice, dilapidated houses, poor hygienic conditions, poor ventilation, lack of basic amenities, like drinking water,light and toilet facilities, etc.
2694. Open defecation, unregulated drainage systems and overcrowded narrow street patterns are serious health and socio-environmental hazards.
2695. Consequently, they are the undernourished, prone to different types of diseases and illness. 
2696. These people can not afford to give proper education to their children.
2697. The poverty makes them vulnerable to drug abuse, alcoholism, crime, vandalism, escapism, apathy and ultimately social exclusion.
2698. The Swachh Bharat Mission (SBM) is part of the urban renewal mission launched by the Government of India to improve the quality of life in urban slums.
2699. The pressure on agricultural land increases not only due to the limited availability but also by deterioration of quality of agricultural land.
2700. You have learnt in the previous chapter about the advantages of a globe
2701. However, the globe has limitations as well.
2702. A globe can be useful when we want to study the earth as a whole.
2703. But, when we want to study only a part of the earth, as about our country, states, districts, towns and villages, it is of little help.
2704. In such a situation we use maps.
2705. A map is a representation or a drawing of the earth’s surface or a part of it drawn on a flat surface according to a scale.
2706. But it is impossible to flatten a round shape completely.
2707. We find that maps are useful to us for various purposes.
2708. One map shows a small area and a few facts.
2709. Another map may contain as many facts as a big book.
2710. When many maps are put together we get an Atlas.
2711. Atlases are of various sizes, measurements drawn on different scales.
2712. Maps provide more information than a globe.
2713. They are of different types.
2714. Some of them are described below.
2715. Take an old rubber ball and draw whatever you like all over it.
2716. You may also mark north pole and south pole on it.
2717. Now cut this ball with a knife and try to flatten it.
2718. Notice how the drawings are distorted
2719. Maps showing natural features of the earth such as mountains, plateaus, plains, rivers, oceans etc. are called physical or relief maps.
2720. Maps showing cities, towns and villages, and different countries and states of the world with their boundaries are called political maps.
2721. Some maps focus on specific information; such as road maps, rainfall maps, maps showing distribution of forests, industries etc. are known as thematic maps.
2722. Suitable titles are given on the basis of information provided in these maps.
2723. There are three Components of Maps – distance, direction and symbol.
2724. DISTANCE
2725. Or we can say maps are drawn to reduced scales.
2726. But this reduction is done very carefully so that the distance between the places is real.
2727. It can only be possible when a small distance on paper represents a large distance on the ground.
2728. Therefore, a scale is chosen for this purpose.
2729. Scale is the ratio between the actual distance on the ground and the distance shown on the map.
2730. For example, the distance between your school and your home is 10 km If you show this 10 km. distance by 2 cm on a map, it means, 1 cm on the map will show 5 km. on the ground.
2731. The scale of your drawing will be 1cm = 5 km.
2732. Thus, scale is very important in any map.
2733. If you know the scale, you will be able to calculate the distance between any two places on a map.
2734. When large areas like continents or countries are to be shown on a paper, then we use a small scale.
2735. For example 5 cm. on the map shows 500 km. of the ground.
2736. It is called a small scale map.
2737. When a small area like your village or town is to be shown on paper, then we use a large scale that is 5 cm. on the map shows 500 metres only on the ground.
2738. It is called a large scale map.
2739. Large scale maps give more information than small scale maps.
2740. Let’s Do
2741. Look at the Figure 4.1. There is a scale.
2742. It may be used for measuring distance between places.
2743. For example the distance between the well and the tree is 5 cm.
2744. It means that the actual distance is 50 metres.
2745. Now the distance between the PO (A) to Karim’s house (E) is 12 cm.
2746. It means 120 metres on the ground but you can not fly like a bird directly from E to A.
2747. You will have to walk on the road.
2748. Let us measure the total walking distance from E to C, then C to M, M to B and B to A. Add all these distances.
2749. This will be the total walking distance from Karim’s house to the post office
2750. Let us measure the total walking distance from E to C, then C to M, M to B and B to A.
2751. It is an instrument used to find out main directions. Its magnetic needle always points towards north-south direction
2752. It is the third important component of a map.
2753. It is not possible to draw on a map the actual shape and size of different features such as buildings, roads, bridges, trees, railway lines or a well.
2754. So, they are shown by using certain letters, shades, colours, pictures and lines
2755. These symbols give a lot of information in a limited space.
2756. With the use of these symbols, maps can be drawn easily and are simple to read.
2757. Even if you don’t know the language of an area and therefore cannot ask someone for directions, you can collect information from maps with the help of these symbols.
2758. Maps have a universal language that can be understood by all.
2759. There is an international agreement regarding the use of these symbols.
2760. These are called conventional symbols.
2761. Some of the conventional symbols are shown in the Figure 4.3
2762. Various colours are used for the same purpose.
2763. For example, generally blue is used for showing water bodies, brown for mountain, yellow for plateau and green is used for plains.
2764. Look at the Figure 4.4 and find out : In which direction is the river flowing?
2765. What kind of road passes by the side of village Dumri?
2766. On what type of railway line is Sunderpur situated ?
2767. On which side of the railway bridge is the police station situated?
2768. On which side of the railway line do the following lie.
2769. A sketch is a drawing mainly based on memory and spot observation and not to scale.
2770. Sometimes a rough drawing is required of an area to tell where a particular place is located with respect to other places.
2771. Suppose, you want to go to your friend’s house, but you don’t know the way.
2772. Your friend may make a rough drawing to show the way to his house.
2773. Such a rough drawing is drawn without scale, and is called a sketch map.
2774. A plan is a drawing of a small area on a large scale.
2775. A large-scale map gives a lot of information, but there are certain things which we may sometimes want to know, for example the length and breadth of a room, which can’t be shown in a map.
2776. At that time, we can refer to drawings drawn to scale called a plan.
2777. Let’s Do Visit web portal School Bhuvan-NCERT 
2778. draw online neighbourhood maps on satellite images.
2779. Answer the following questions briefly.
2780. What are the three components of a map?
2781. What are the four cardinal directions?
2782. What do you mean by the term ‘the scale of the map’?
2783. How are maps more helpful than a globe?
2784. Distinguish between a map and a plan.
2785. Which map provides detailed information?
2786. How do symbols help in reading maps?
2787. Tick the correct answers.
2788. Maps showing distribution of forests are

2790. A compass is used –
2791. To show symbols
2792. To find the main direction
2793. To measure distance
2794. A scale is necessary
2795. Draw a plan of your classroom and show the teacher’s table, blackboard, desks, door and windows.
2796. Draw a sketch of your school and locate the following :
2797. Make the plan of a fun-park where you can enjoy several activities :
2798. For example swings, slides, see-saw, merry-go-round, boating, swimming, looking into funny mirrors, etc. or anything else that you can think of.
2799. As you have read in the first chapter, the earth is the only planet which has life.
2800. Human beings can live here because the life sustaining elements of land, water and air are present on the earth.
2801. The surface of the earth is a complex zone in which three main components of the environment meet, overlap and interact.
2802. The solid portion of the earth on which we live is called the Lithosphere.
2803. The gaseous layers that surround the earth, is the Atmosphere, where oxygen, nitrogen, carbon dioxide and other gases are found.
2804. Water covers a very big area of the earth’s surface and this area is called the Hydrosphere.
2805. The Hydrosphere comprises water in all its forms, that is, ice, water and water vapour.
2806. The Biosphere is the narrow zone where we find land, water and air together, which contains all forms of life.
2807. The solid portion of the earth is called the Lithosphere.
2808. It comprises the rocks of the earth’s crust and the thin layers of soil that contain nutrient elements which sustain organisms.
2809. There are two main divisions of the earth’s surface.
2810. The large land masses are known as the continents and the huge water bodies are called the ocean basins.
2811. All the oceans of the world are connected with one another.
2812. Are all the land masses connected with one another?
2813. The level of seawater remains the same everywhere.
2814. Elevation of land is measured from the level of the sea,
2815. which is taken as zero
2816. The highest mountain peak Mt. Everest is 8,848 metres above sea level.
2817. The greatest depth of 11,022 metres is recorded at Mariana Trench in the Pacific Ocean.
2818. Could you imagine that depth of the sea is much more than the highest point?
2819. There are seven major continents.
2820. These are separated by large water bodies.
2821. These continents are – Asia, Europe, Africa, North America, South America, Australia and Antarctica.
2822. Asia is the largest continent.
2823. It covers about one third of the total land area of the earth.
2824. The continent lies in the Eastern Hemisphere.
2825. The Tropic of Cancer passes through this continent.
2826. Asia is separated from Europe by the Ural mountains on the west.
2827. The combined landmass of Europe and Asia is called Eurasia.
2828. Europe is much smaller than Asia.
2829. The continent lies to the west of Asia.
2830. The Arctic Circle passes through it.
2831. It is bound by water bodies on three sides.
2832. Look at the map of the world and locate it.
2833. Africa is the second largest continent after Asia.
2834. The Equator or 0 latitude runs almost through the middle of the continent.
2835. A large part of Africa lies in the Northern Hemisphere.
2836. The Sahara Desert, the world’s largest hot desert, is located in Africa.
2837. The continent is bound on all sides by oceans and seas.
2838. You will notice that the world’s longest river, the Nile, flows through Africa.
2839. Notice where the Equator, the Tropic of Cancer and the Tropic of Capricorn pass in the map of Africa.
2840. North America is the third largest continent of the world.
2841. It is linked to South America by a very narrow strip of land called the Isthmus of Panama.
2842. The continent lies completely in the Northern and Western Hemisphere.
2843. Three oceans surround this continent.
2844. Can you name these oceans?
2845. South America lies mostly in the Southern Hemisphere.
2846. Which two oceans surround it on the east and the west?
2847. The Andes, the world's longest mountain range, runs through its length from north to south.
2848. South America has the world’s largest river, the Amazon.
2849. Australia is the smallest continent that lies entirely in the Southern Hemisphere.
2850. It is surrounded on all sides by the oceans and seas.
2851. It is called an island continent.
2852. Antarctica, completely in the Southern Hemisphere, is a huge continent.
2853. The South Pole lies almost at the centre of this continent.
2854. As it is located in the South Polar Region, it is permanently covered with thick ice sheets.
2855. There are no permanent human settlements.
2856. Many countries have research stations in Antarctica.
2857. India also has research stations there.
2858. These are named as Maitri and Dakshin Gangotri.
2859. The earth is called the blue planet.
2860. More than 71 percent of the earth is covered with water and 29 percent is with land.
2861. Hydrosphere consists of water in all its forms.
2862. As running water in oceans and rivers and in lakes, ice in glaciers, underground water and the water vapour in the atmosphere, all comprise the hydrosphere.
2863. More than 97% of the Earth’s water is found in the oceans and is too salty for human use.
2864. A large proportion of the rest of the water is in the form of ice sheets and glaciers or under the ground. 
2865. A very small percentage is available as fresh water for human use.
2866. Hence, despite being a ‘blue planet’ we face a shortage of water!!
2867. Oceans are the major part of the hydrosphere.
2868. They are all interconnected.
2869. The ocean waters are always moving.
2870. The three chief movements of ocean waters are the waves, the tides and the ocean currents.
2871. The five major oceans are the Pacific Ocean, the Atlantic Ocean, the Indian Ocean, the Southern Ocean and the Arctic Ocean, in order of their size.
2872. The Pacific Ocean is the largest ocean.
2873. It is spread over one-third of the earth.
2874. Mariana Trench, the deepest part of the earth, lies in the Pacific Ocean.
2875. The Pacific Ocean is almost circular in shape.
2876. Asia, Australia,North and South Americas surround it.
2877. The Atlantic Ocean is the second largest Ocean in the world.
2878. It is ‘S’ shaped.
2879. It is flanked by the North and South Americas on the western side, and Europe and Africa on the eastern side.
2880. The coastline of the Atlantic Ocean is highly indented.
2881. This irregular and indented coastline provides an ideal location for natural harbours and ports.
2882. From the point of view of commerce, it is the busiest Ocean.
2883. The Indian Ocean is the only ocean named after a country, that is, India.
2884. The shape of the ocean is almost triangular.
2885. In the north, it is bound by Asia, in the west by Africa and in the east by Australia.
2886. The Southern Ocean encircles the continent of Antarctica and extends northward to 60 degrees south latitude.
2887. extends northward to 60 degrees south latitude.
2888. The Arctic Ocean is located within the Arctic Circle and surrounds the North Pole.
2889. It is connected with the Pacific Ocean by a narrow stretch of shallow water known as Berring strait.
2890. It is bound by northern coasts of North America and Eurasia
2891. The earth is surrounded by a layer of gas called the atmosphere.
2892. This thin blanket of air is an integral and important aspect of the planet.
2893. It provides us with the air we breathe and protects us from the harmful effects of sun’s rays.
2894. The atmosphere extends up to a height of about 1,600 kilometres.
2895. The atmosphere is divided into five layers based on composition, temperature and other properties.
2896. These layers starting from earth’s surface are of 5 types
2897. are called the troposphere, the stratosphere, the mesosphere, the thermosphere and the exosphere.
2898. The atmosphere is composed mainly of nitrogen and oxygen, which make up about 99 per cent of clean, dry air.
2899. Nitrogen 78 percent, oxygen 21 percent and other gases like carbon dioxide, argon and others comprise 1 per cent by volume.
2900. Oxygen is the breath of life while nitrogen helps in the growth of living organisms.
2901. Carbon dioxide, though present in minute amounts, is important as it absorbs heat radiated by the earth, thereby keeping the planet warm.
2902. It is also essential for the growth of plants.
2903. The density of the atmosphere varies with height.
2904. It is maximum at sea level and decreases rapidly as we go up.
2905. You know, the climbers experience problems in breathing due to this decrease in the density of air.
2906. They have to carry with them oxygen cylinders to be able to breathe at high altitudes.
2907. The temperature also decreases as we go upwards.
2908. The atmosphere exerts pressure on the earth.
2909. This varies from place to place.
2910. Some areas experience high pressure and some areas low pressure.
2911. Air moves from high pressure to low pressure.
2912. Moving air is known as wind.
2913. The biosphere is the narrow zone of contact between the land, water and air.
2914. It is in this zone that life, that is unique to this planet, exists.
2915. There are several species of organisms that vary in size from microbes and bacteria to huge mammals.
2916. All the living organisms including humans are linked to each other and to the biosphere for survival.
2917. The organisms in the biosphere may broadly be divided into the plant kingdom and the animal kingdom.
2918. The three domains of the earth interact with each other and affect each other in some way or the other.
2919. For example, cutting of forests for fulfilling our needs of wood, or clearing land for agriculture may lead to fast removal of soil from slopes.
2920. Similarly earth’s surface may be changed due to natural calamities like earthquakes.
2921. For example, there could be submergence of land, as happened in the case of Tsunami recently in Andaman and nicobar.
2922. Discharge of waste material into lakes and rivers makes the water unsuitable for human use.
2923. It also damages other forms of life.
2924. Emissions from industries, thermal power plants and vehicles, pollute the air.
2925. Carbon dioxide (CO2) is an important constituent of air.
2926. But an increase in the amount of CO2 leads to an increase in global temperatures.
2927. This is termed as global warming.
2928. There is thus a need to limit the use of resources of the earth to maintain the balance of nature between the domains of the lithosphere, the atmosphere and the hydrosphere.
2929. Answer the following questions briefly.
2930. What are the four major domains of the earth?
2931. Name the major continents of the earth.
2932. Name the two continents that lie entirely in the Southern Hemisphere.
2933. Name the different layers of atmosphere.
2934. Why is the earth called the ‘blue planet’?
2935. Why is the Northern Hemisphere called the Land Hemisphere?
2936. Why is the Biosphere important for living organisms?
2937. Dispersed or isolated settlement patterns in India appear in the form of isolated huts or hamlets of few huts in remote jungles, or on small hills with farms or pasture on the slopes.
2938. Extreme dispersion of settlement is often caused by the extremely fragmented nature of the terrain and land resource base of habitable areas.
2939. Many areas of Meghalaya, Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh and Kerala have this type of settlement.
2940. Unlike rural settlements, urban settlements are generally compact and larger in size.
2941. They are engaged in a variety of non-agricultural, economic and administrative functions.
2942. As mentioned earlier, cities are functionally linked to rural areas around them.
2943. Thus, exchange of goods and services is performed sometimes directly and sometimes through a series of market towns and cities.
2944. Thus, cities are connected directly as well as indirectly with the villages and also with each other. 
2945. You can see the definition of towns in Chapter 10 of the book, “Fundamentals of Human Geography.”
2946. Towns flourished since prehistoric times in India.
2947. Even at the time of Indus valley civilization, towns like Harappa and Mohenjo Daro were in existence.
2948. The following period has witnessed evolution of towns.
2949. It continued with periodic ups and downs until the arrival of Europeans in India in the eighteenth century.
2950. On the basis of their evolution in different periods, Indian towns may be classified as: Ancient towns, Medieval towns, and Modern towns.
2951. Ancient Towns There are a number of towns in India having historical background spanning over 2000 years.
2952. Most of them developed as religious and cultural centres.
2953. Varanasi is one of the important towns among these.
2954. Prayag (Allahabad),Pataliputra (Patna), Madurai are some other examples of ancient towns in the country.
2955. Medieval Towns About 100 of the existing towns have their roots in the medieval period.
2956. Most of them developed as headquarters of principalities and kingdoms.
2957. These are fort towns which came up on the ruins of ancient towns.
2958. Important among them are Delhi, Hyderabad, Jaipur, Lucknow, Agra and Nagpur.
2959. Modern Towns The British and other Europeans have developed a number of towns in India.Starting their foothold on coastal locations, they first developed some trading ports such as Surat, Daman, Goa, Pondicherry, etc.
2960. The British later consolidated their hold around three principal nodes – Mumbai (Bombay), Chennai (Madras), and Kolkata (Calcutta) –and built them in the British style.Rapidly extending their domination either directly or through control over the princely states, they established their administrative centres, hill towns as summer resorts, and added new civil,administrative and military areas to them.
2961. Towns based on modern industries also evolved after 1850. Jamshedpur can be cited as an example.
2962. After independence, a large number of towns have been developed as administrative headquarters, e.g., Chandigarh, Bhubaneswar,Gandhinagar, Dispur, etc., and industrial centres, such as Durgapur, Bhilai, Sindri,Barauni.
2963. Some old towns also developed as satellite towns around metropolitan cities, such as Ghaziabad, Rohtak, Gurugram around Delhi.With increasing investment in rural areas, a large number of medium and small towns have developed all over the country.
2964. Urbanisation in India The level of urbanisation is measured in terms of percentage of urban population to total population.
2965. The level of urbanisation in India in 2011 was 31.16 per cent, which is quite low in comparison to developed countries.
2966.  Total urban population has Increased eleven fold during the twentieth century 
2967. Enlargement of urban centres and emergence of new towns have played a significant role in the growth of urban population and urbanisation in the country. 
2968.  But the growth rate of urbanisation has slowed down during the last two decades.
2969. Classification of Towns on the basis of Population Size
2970. Census of India classifies urban centres into six classes as presented in Table 4.2.
2971. Urban centre with population of more than one lakh is called a city or class I town. 
2972. Cities accommodating population size between one to five million are called metropolitan cities and more than five million are mega cities. 
2973.  Majority of metropolitan and mega cities are urban agglomerations. An urban agglomeration may consist of any one of the following three combinations: 
2974.  a town and its adjoining urban outgrowths. two or more contiguous towns with or without their outgrowths, and a city and one or more adjoining towns with their outgrowths together forming a contiguous spread.
2975. It is evident from Table 4.2 that more than60 percent of urban population in India lives in Class I towns.
2976. Out of 468 cities, 53 cities/urban agglomerations are metropolitan cities.
2977. Six of them are mega cities with a population over five million each.
2978. More than one-fifth (21.0%) of urban population lives in these mega cities.
2979. Among them, Greater Mumbai is the largest agglomeration with 18.4 million people.
2980. Delhi, Kolkata, Chennai,Bengaluru and Hyderabad are other mega cities in the country.
2981. Functional Classification of Towns
2982. Apart from their role as central or nodal places, many towns and cities perform specialised services.
2983. Some towns and cities specialise in certain functions and they are known for some specific activities, products or services.
2984. However, each town performs a number of functions.
2985. On the basis of dominant or specialised functions,Indian cities and towns can be broadly classified as follows:
2986. Administrative towns and cities
2987. Towns supporting administrative headquarters of higher order are administrative towns,such as Chandigarh, New Delhi, Bhopal, Shillong, Guwahati, Imphal, Srinagar, Gandhinagar,Jaipur, Chennai, etc.
2988. Mumbai, Salem, Coimbatore, Modinagar, Jamshedpur, Hugli, Bhilai, etc.Industries constitute prime motive force of these cities.
2989. They may be ports primarily engaged in export and import activities such as Kandla, Kochchi, Kozhikode, Visakhapatnam, etc., or hubs of inland transport, such as Agra, Dhulia, Mughalsarai, Itarsi, Katni, etc.
2990. Towns and cities specialising in trade and commerce are kept in this class.
2991. Kolkata, Saharanpur, Satna, etc., are some examples.
2992. These towns have developed in mineral rich areas such as Raniganj,Jharia, Digboi, Ankaleshwar, Singrauli, etc.
2993. These towns emerged as garrison towns such as Ambala, Jalandhar, Mhow, Babina Udhampur, etc.
2994. List the urban agglomerations/cities state-wise and see the state-wise population under this category of cities.
2995. The objective of the Smart Cities Mission is to promote cities that provide core infrastructure, a clean and sustainable environment and give a decent quality of life to its citizens.
2996. One of the features of Smart Cities is to apply smart solutions to infrastructure and services in order to make them better.
2997. For example, making areas less vulnerable to disasters,using fewer resources and providing cheaper services.
2998. The focus is on sustainable and inclusive development and the idea is to look at compact areas, create a replicable model, which will act like a lighthouse to other aspiring cities.
2999. Varanasi, Mathura, Amritsar, Madurai, Puri, Ajmer, Pushkar, Tirupati, Kurukshetra Haridwar, Ujjain came to prominence due to their religious/cultural significance.
3000. Starting as centres of education, some of the towns have grown into major campus towns,such as Roorki, Varanasi, Aligarh, Pilani, Allahabad, etc.
3001. Nainital, Mussoorie, Shimla, Pachmarhi, Jodhpur, Jaisalmer, Udagamandalam (Ooty) Mount Abu are some of the tourist destinations.
3002. The cities are not static in their function
3003. The functions change due to their dynamic nature
3004. Even specialized cities, as they grow into metropolises become multifunctional wherein industry, business, administration, transport, etc., become important.
3005. The functions get so intertwined that the city can not be categorised in a particular functional class.
3006. Choose the right answers of the following from the given options
3007. Which one of the following towns is NOT located on a river bank?
3008. Which one of the following is NOT the part of the definition of a town as per the census of India?
3009. In which one of the following environments does one expect the presence of dispersed rural settlements
3010. Which one of the following group of cities have been arranged in the sequence of their ranks i.e. 1, 2, 3 and 4 in size
3011. Answer the following questions in about 30 words
3012. Answer the following questions in about 150 words.
3013. LAND RESOURCES AND AGRICULTURE
3014. You must have observed that the land around you is put to different uses
3015. Some land is occupied by rivers, some may have trees and on some parts roads and buildings have been built
3016. Different types of lands are suited to different uses
3017. Human beings thus, use land as a resource for production as well as residence and recreation
3018. Thus, the building of your school, roads on which you travel, parks in which you play, fields in which crops are grown and the pastures where animals graze represent different uses to which land is put
3019. Land Use Categories
3020. Land-use records are maintained by land revenue department
3021. The land use categories add up to reporting area, which is somewhat different from the geographical area
3022. The Survey of India is responsible for measuring geographical area of administrative units in India
3023. Have you ever used a map prepared by Survey of India
3024. The difference between the two concepts are that while the former changes somewhat depending on the estimates of the land revenue records.
3025. The latter does not change and stays fixed as per Survey of India measurements
3026. You may be familiar with land use categories as they are also included in your Social Science textbook of Class X
3027. The land-use categories as maintained in the Land Revenue Records are as follows
3028. It is important to note that area under actual forest cover is different from area classified as forest
3029. The latter is the area which the Government has identified and demarcated for forest growth
3030. The land revenue records are consistent with the latter definition
3031. Thus, there may be an increase in this category without any increase in the actual forest cover
3032. The land which may be classified as a wasteland such as barren hilly terrains, desert lands, ravines, etc. normally cannot be brought under cultivation with the available technology.
3033.  Land put to Non-agricultural Uses : Land under settlements (rural and urban), infrastructure (roads, canals, etc.), industries, shops, etc., are included in this category.
3034. An expansion in the secondary and tertiary activities would lead to an increase in this category of land-use.
3035.  Area under Permanent Pastures and Grazing Lands : Most of this type land is owned by the village ‘Panchayat’ or the Government. 
3036. Only a small proportion of this land is privately owned. 
3037. The land owned by the village panchayat comes under ‘Common Property Resources’.
3038. Area under Miscellaneous Tree Crops and Groves : The land under orchards and fruit trees are included in this category. Much of this land is privately owned.
3039. Culturable Wasteland :Any land which is left fallow (uncultivated) for more than five years is included in this category.
3040. It can be brought under cultivation after improving it through reclamation practices.
3041.  Current Fallow This is the land which : is left without cultivation for one or less than one agricultural year. . 
3042. Following is a cultural practice adopted for giving the land rest.
3043. The land recoups the lost fertility through natural processes.
3044. Fallow other than Current Fallow : This is also a cultivable land which is left uncultivated for more than a year but less than five years.
3045. If the land is left uncultivated for more than five years, it would be categorised as culturable wasteland.
3046.  Net Area Sown: The physical extent of land on which crops are sown and harvested is known as net sown area.
3047. Land-use Changes in India
3048. Land-use in a region, to a large extent, is influenced by the nature of economic activities carried out in that region
3049.  However, while economic activities change over time, land, like many other natural resources, is fixed in terms of its area
3050. .At this stage, one needs to appreciate three types of changes that an economy undergoes, which affect land-use.
3051. The size of the economy (measured in terms of value for all the goods and services produced in the economy) grows over time as a result of increasing population, change in income levels, available technology and associated factors
3052. As a result, the pressure on land will increase with time and marginal lands would come under use.
3053. Secondly, the composition of the economy would undergo a change over time.
3054.  In other words, the secondary and the tertiary sectors usually grow much faster than the primary sector, specifically the agricultural sector
3055.  This type of change is common in developing countries, like India.
3056.  This process would result in a gradual shift of land from agricultural uses to non-agricultural uses. 
3057. You would observe that such changes are sharp around large urban areas where agricultural land is being used for building purposes.
3058.  Thirdly, though the contribution of the agricultural activities reduces over time, the pressure on land for agricultural activities does not decline.
3059.  The reasons for continued pressure on agricultural land are:
3060. In developing countries, the share of population dependent on agriculture usually declines much more slowly compared to the decline in the sector's share in GDP.
3061.  The number of people that the agricultural sector has to feed is increasing day by day.
3062. changes in shares of land-use categories in India: 1950-51  and 2014-15
3063. Activity
3064. Compare the changes of land-use between 1950-57 and 2014-15
3065. India has undergone major changes within the economy over the past four or five decades, and this has influenced the land-use changes in the country. These changes between 1950–51 and 2014–15 have been shown in Fig. 5.1. 
3066. There are two points that you need to remember before you derive some meaning from this figure. Firstly, the percentages shown in the figure have been derived with respect to the reporting area
3067. Four categories have undergone increases, while four have registered declines. Share of area under forest, area under non-agricultural uses, current fallow lands and net area sown have shown an increase.
3068.  The following observations can be made about these increases:
3069.  The rate of increase is the highest in case of areas under non-agricultural uses.
3070. This is due to the changing structure of Indian economy, which is increasingly dependent on the contribution from industrial and services sectors and expansion of related infrastructural facilities.
3071. Also, an expansion of area under both urban and rural settlements has added to the increase. Thus, the area under non-agricultural uses is increasing at the expense of wastelands and agricultural land.
3072.  The increase in the share under forest, as explained before, can be accounted for by an increase in the demarcated area under forest rather than an actual increase in the forest cover in the country.
3073.  The increase in the current fallow cannot be explained from information pertaining to only two points. The trend of current fallow fluctuates a great deal over years, depending on the variability of rainfall and cropping cycles.
3074. The increase in net area sown in recent phenomenon due to use of cultural waste land for agricultural purpose
3075. Before which it was registering a slow decrease. There are indications that most of the decline had occurred due to the increases in area under non agricultural use
3076. (Note : the expansion of building activity on agricultural land in your village and city)
3077. The four categories that have registered a decline are barren and wasteland, culturable wasteland, area under pastures and tree crops and fallow lands.
3078. India was the second largest producer of sugarcane after Brazil in 2017.
3079. It accounts for about 19 percent of the world production of sugarcane.
3080. But it occupies only 2.4 per cent of total cropped area in the country.
3081. Uttar Pradesh produces about two-fifths of sugarcane of the country.
3082. Maharashtra, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, and Andhra Pradesh are other leading producers of this crop where yield level of sugarcane is high.
3083. Its yield is low in northern India.
3084. Tea
3085. Tea is a plantation crop used as a beverage.
3086. Black tea leaves are fermented whereas green tea leaves are unfermented.
3087. Tea leaves have a rich content of caffeine and tannin.
3088. It is an indigenous crop of hills in northern China.
3089. It is grown over undulating topography of hilly areas and well drained soils in humid and sub-humid tropics and sub-tropics.
3090. In India, tea plantations started in 1840s in Brahmaputra valley of Assam which still is a major tea growing area in the country.
3091. Later on, its plantation was introduced in the sub-Himalayan region of West Bengal (Darjeeling, Jalpaiguri and Cooch Behar districts).
3092. Tea is also cultivated on the lower slopes of Nilgiri and Cardamom hills in Western Ghats.
3093. India is a leading producer of tea and accounts for about 21.7 per cent of total production in the world 2017.
3094. India's share in the international market of tea has declined substantially.
3095. It ranks second among tea exporting countries in the world after China (2016).
3096. Assam accounts for about 53.2 per cent of the total cropped area and contributes more than half of total production of tea in the country.
3097. West Bengal and Tamil Nadu are the other leading producers of tea.
3098. Coffee
3099. Coffee is a tropical plantation crop.
3100. Its seeds are roasted, ground and are used for preparing a beverage.
3101. There are three varieties of coffee i.e. arabica, robusta and liberica.
3102. India mostly grows superior quality coffee, arabica, which is in great demand in International market.
3103. But India produces only about 3.4 per cent coffee of the world and ranks eighth after Brazil, Vietnam, Colombia, Indonesia, Honduras, Ethopia and Peru in 2017.
3104. Coffee is cultivated in the highlands of Western Ghats in Karnataka, Kerala and Tamil Nadu.
3105. Karnataka alone accounts for more than two-third of total production of coffee in the country.
3106. Agricultural Development in India
3107. Indian agricultural economy was largely subsistence in nature before Independence.
3108. It had dismal performance in the first half of twentieth century.
3109. This period witnessed severe droughts and famines.
3110. During partition about one-third of the irrigated land in undivided India went to Pakistan.
3111. This reduced the proportion of irrigated area in Independence.
3112. India After Independence, the immediate goal of the Government was to increase foodgrains production by (i) switching over from cash crops to food crops (ii) intensification of cropping over already cultivated land; and (iii) increasing cultivated area by bringing cultivable and fallow land under plough.
3113. Initially, this strategy helped in increasing foodgrains production but agricultural production stagnated during late-1950s.
3114. To overcome this problem, Intensive Agricultural District Programme (IADP) and Intensive Agricultural Area Programme (IAAP) were launched.
3115. But two consecutive droughts during mid-1960s resulted in food crisis in the country.
3116. Consequently, foodgrains were imported from other countries.
3117. New seed varieties of wheat (Mexico) and rice (Philippines) known as high yielding varieties (HYVS) were available for cultivation by mid-1960s.
3118. India took advantage of this and introduced package technology comprising HYVS, along with chemical fertilisers in irrigated areas of Punjab, Haryana, Western Uttar Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh and Gujarat.
3119. Assured supply of soil moisture through irrigation was a basic pre-requisite for the success of this new agricultural technology.
3120. This spurt of agricultural growth came to be known as the Green Revolution.
3121. This also gave fillip to the development of a large number of agro-inputs, agro-processing industries and small-scale industries.
3122. This strategy of agricultural development made the country self-reliant in foodgrain production. But the Green Revolution was initially confined to irrigated areas only.
3123. This led to regional disparities in agricultural development in the country till 1970s, after which the technology spread to the Eastern and Central parts of the country.
3124. The Planning Commission of India focused its attention on the problems of agriculture in rainfed areas in 1980s.
3125. It initiated agro-climatic planning in 1988 to induce regionally balanced agricultural development in the country.
3126. It also emphasised on the need for diversification of agriculture and harnessing of resources for the development of dairy farming, poultry, horticulture, livestock rearing and aquaculture.
3127. Initiation of the policy of liberalisation and free market economy in the 1990s influenced the course of development of Indian agriculture.
3128. National Mission for Sustainable Agriculture (NMSA)
3129. National Mission for Sustainable Agriculture is to make agriculture more productive, sustainable, remunerative and climate resilient by promoting location specific integrated/composite farming systems and to conserve natural resources through appropriate soil and moisture conservation measures.
3130. The Government has been promoting organic farming in the country through schemes such as Paramparagat Krishi Vikas Yojana (PKVY) and Rashtriya Vikas Yojana (RKVY).
3131. Growth of Agricultural Output and Technology
3132. There has been a significant increase in agricultural output and improvement in technology during the last 50 years.
3133. Production and yield of many crops such as rice and wheat has increased at an impressive rate. Among the other crops the production of sugarcane, oilseeds and cotton has also increased appreciably.
3134. "Expansion of irrigation has played a crucial role in enhancing agricultural output in the country.
3135. It provided the basis for the introduction of modern agricultural technology, such as high yielding varieties of seeds, chemical fertilizers, pesticides and farm machinery.
3136. Farmer's Portal of India
3137. The Farmer's Portal is a platform for farmers to seek any information related to agriculture.
3138. Detailed information on farmers' insurance, agriculture storage, crops, extension activities, seeds. pesticides, farm machineries, etc. is provided.
3139. Details of fertilizers, market prices, package and practices, programmes, welfare schemes are also given.
3140. Details of fertilizers, market prices, package and practices, programmes, welfare schemes are also given.
3141. Users can also download farm friendly handbooks, scheme guidelines, etc.
3142. Consumption of chemical fertilizers has increased by 15 times 
3143. Since the high yielding varieties are highly susceptible to pests and diseases, the use of pesticides has increased significantly since 1960s
3144. Problems of Indian Agriculture
3145. The nature of problems faced by Indian agriculture varies according to agro-ecological and historical experiences of its different regions.
3146. Hence, most of the agricultural problems in the country are region specific.
3147. Yet, there are some problems which are common and range from physical constraints to institutional hindrances.
3148. A detailed discussion on these problems follows:
3149. Dependence on Erratic Monsoon
3150. Irrigation covers only about 33 per cent of the cultivated area in India.
3151. The crop production in rest of the cultivated land directly depends on rain.
3152. Poor performance of south-west monsoon also adversely affects the supply of canal water for irrigation.
3153. On the other hand, the rainfall in Rajasthan and other drought-prone areas is too meagre and highly unreliable.
3154. Even the areas receiving high annual rainfall experience considerable fluctuations.
3155. This makes them vulnerable to both droughts and floods.
3156. Drought is a common phenomenon in the low rainfall areas, which may also experience occasional floods.
3157. The flash floods in drylands of Maharashtra, Gujarat and Rajasthan in 2006 and 2017 are examples of this phenomenon.
3158. Droughts and floods continue to be the twin menace in Indian agriculture.
3159. Low Productivity
3160. The yield of the crops in the country is low in comparison to the international level.
3161. Per hectare output of most of the crops such as rice, wheat, cotton and oilseeds in India is much lower than that of the U.S.A., Russia and Japan.
3162. Because of the very high pressure on the land resources, the labour productivity in Indian agriculture is also very low in comparison to international level.
3163. The vast rainfed areas of the country, particularly drylands which mostly grow coarse cereals, pulses and oilseeds have low yields.
3164. Why is agricultural productivity low in dry regions?
3165. Constraints of Financial Resources and Indebtedness
3166. The inputs of modern agriculture are very expensive.
3167. This resource intensive approach has become unmanageable for marginal and small farmers as they have very meagre or no savings to invest in agriculture. 
3168. To tide over these difficulties, most of such farmers have resorted to availing credit from various institutions and moneylenders.
3169. Crop failures and low returns from agriculture have forced them to fall in the trap of indebtedness.
3170. What are the implications of severe indebtedness?
3171.  Do you feel that the recent incidents of farmers’ suicides in different states of the country are the result of indebtedness?
3172. Lack of Land Reforms
3173. Indian peasantry had been exploited for a long time as there had been unequal distribution of land.
3174. Among the three revenue systems operational during the British period, i.e., Mahalwari, Ryotwari and Zamindari, the last one was most exploitative for the peasants.
3175. After Independence, land reforms were accorded priority, but these reforms were not implemented effectively due to lack of strong political will.
3176. Most of the state governments avoided taking politically tough decisions which went against strong political lobbies of landlords.
3177. Lack of implementation of land reforms has resulted in continuation of iniquitous distribution of cultivable land which is detrimental to agricultural development.
3178. Small Farm Size and Fragmentation of Landholdings
3179. There are a large number of marginal and small farmers in the country.
3180. More than 60 percent of the farmers have land holdings of less than one hectare and about 40 percent of the farmers have less than 0.5 hectares of landholdings. 
3181. The average size of land holding is shrinking under increasing population pressure.
3182. Furthermore, in India, the land holdings are mostly fragmented.
3183. There are some states where consolidation of holding has not been carried out even once.
3184. Even in the states where it has been carried out once, second consolidation is required as land holdings have fragmented again in the process of division of land among the owners of the next generations.
3185. The small size of fragmented landholdings are uneconomic.
3186. Lack of Commercialisation
3187. A large number of farmers produce crops for self-consumption.
3188. These farmers do not have enough land resources to produce more than their requirements.
3189. Most of the small and marginal farmers grow foodgrains,
3190. which are meant for their own family consumption.
3191. Modernisation and commercialisation of agriculture have, however, taken place in the irrigated areas.
3192. What changes have you noticed in the agricultural sector and cropping pattern?
3193. Discuss in the class.
3194. Vast Underemployment
3195. There is a massive underemployment in the agricultural sector in India, particularly in the unirrigated tracts.
3196. In these areas, there is seasonal unemployment ranging from 4 to 8 months.
3197. Even in the cropping season, work is not available throughout as agricultural operations are not labour intensive.
3198. Hence, the people engaged in agriculture do not have the opportunity to work round the year.
3199. Degradation of Cultivable Land
3200. One of the serious problems that arises out of faulty strategy of irrigation and agricultural development is degradation of land resources.
3201. This is serious because it may lead to depletion of soil fertility
3202. The situation is particularly alarming in irrigated areas.
3203. A large tract of agricultural land has lost its fertility due to alkalisation and salinisation of soils and waterlogging
3204. Excessive use of chemicals such as insecticides and pesticides has led to their concentration in toxic amounts in the soil profile.
3205. Leguminous crops have been displaced from the cropping pattern in the irrigated areas and duration of fallow has substantially reduced owing to multiple cropping.
3206. This has obliterated the process of natural fertilization such as nitrogen fixation.
3207. Rainfed areas in humid and semi-arid tropics also experience degradation of several types like soil erosion by water and wind erosion which are often induced by human activities.
3208. Prepare a list of agricultural problems in your own region. How similar or different are these problems compared to the problems mentioned in this chapter?
3209. Choose the right answers of the following from the given options.
3210. Which one of the following is NOT a land-use category?
3211. What one of the following is the main reason due to which share of forest has shown an increase in the last forty years?
3212. Which one of the following is the main form of degradation in irrigated areas?
3213. Which one of the following crops is not cultivated under dryland farming?
3214. In which of the following group of countries of the world, HYVs of wheat and rice were developed?
3215. Answer the following questions in about 30 words
3216. Differentiate between barren and wasteland and culturable wasteland
3217. How would you distinguish between net sown area and gross cropped area?
3218. Why is the strategy of increasing cropping intensity important in a country like India?
3219. What is the difference between dryland and wetland farming?
3220. Answer the following questions in about 150 words.
3221. What are the different types of environmental problems of land resources in India?
3222. What are the important strategies for agricultural development followed in the post-independence period in India?
3223. You have learnt various methods of data processing and representation that you can use to analyse the geographical phenomena in the preceding chapters.
3224. You must have observed that these methods are time consuming and tedious.
3225. Have you ever thought of a method of data processing and their graphical representation that can save time and improve efficiency?
3226. If you have used a computer for word processing, then you must have noticed that the computer is more versatile as it facilitates the onscreen editing of the text, copy and move it from one place to another, or even delete the unwanted text.
3227. Similarly, the computer may also be used for data processing, preparation of diagrams/graphs and drawing of maps, provided you have access to the related application software.
3228. In other words, a computer can be used for a wide range of applications.
3229. It must, however, be clearly understood that a computer carries out the instructions it receives from the users.
3230. In other words, it cannot perform any function on its own.
3231. In the present chapter, we will discuss the use of computers in data processing and mapping.
3232. What can a Computer do?
3233. A computer is an electronic device.
3234. It consists of various sub-systems, like memory, microprocessor, input system and output system.
3235. All these sub-systems work together to make it an integrated system.
3236. It is an extremely powerful device, which is apt to have an important effect on the systems of data processing, mapping and analysis.
3237. A computer is a fast and versatile machine that can perform simple arithmetic operations, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication and division, and can also solve complex mathematical formulae.
3238. It also performs simple logical operations, distinguishing zero from non-zero and plus from minus and discharge the results.
3239. In short, a computer is a data processor that can perform substantial computation, including numerous arithmetic or logical operations, without intervention by a human operator during the run.
3240. Provided that you have the basic conceptual clarity, a computer can be used very effectively to represent data through maps and diagrams.
3241. The following advantages of a computer make it distinct from the manual methods:
3242. It substantially increases the speed of computation and data processing.
3243. It can handle huge volumes of data, which is normally not possible manually.
3244. It facilitates copy, edit, save and retrieve the data at will.
3245. It further enables validation, checking and correction of data easily.
3246. Aggregation and analysis of data becomes extremely simple.
3247. Computer makes it very easy to perform comparative analysis, whether by drawing maps or graphs.
3248. The type of graph or map (i.e., bar/pie or types of shades), heading, indexing and other formats can be changed very easily.
3249. There are many other advantages that a computer offers, that you will observe yourselves while carrying out your practical work using a computer.
3250. A computer as an aid to data processing and mapping comprises hardware and software.
3251. The hardware configurations comprise storage, display, and input and output sub-systems, whereas software are the programs that are made of electronic codes.
3252. The computer-aided data processing and mapping, hence, requires both hardware components and related application software.
3253. The core of modern computers consists of a central processing unit (CPU), which facilitates the execution of program instructions for processing data and controlling peripheral equipment.
3254. All data together with the operating system and the application programs occupy space in the disk storage unit, which functions as working memory.
3255. The total storage capacity depends upon the types of activity for which the computer is to be used.
3256. The hardware storage capacity for data processing and mapping should be in the range of 1 GB to 4 GB or more and the Random Access Memory (RAM) 32 MB or more.
3257. Besides the disk storage, the secondary storage, such as floppy disks, CD, pen drives and magnetic tapes are also used to store permanently large quantities of data that is not actively being processed.
3258. The operating system is a basic program, which administers the internal data processing in a computer.
3259. The operating systems like MS-DOS, Windows, and UNIX are in general use, with the Windows being the most preferred one.
3260. The data display and output operations vary over a range of functions and are very much dependent on the skills developed in the field of computer graphics.
3261. Some of the common capabilities that the present day softwares provide are:
3262. In the preceding paragraphs, a number of data processing softwares have been referred to.
3263. However, it would be difficult to discuss the capabilities and functions of each one of these softwares under the constraints of time and space.
3264. We will, therefore, describe the procedure that is followed in data processing and the preparation of graphs and diagrams using MS Excel or Spreadsheet program.
3265. The spreadsheet enables us to feed data, compute various statistics and represent the raw data or computed statistics through graphical methods.
3266. As mentioned earlier, MS Excel, Lotus 1 – 2 – 3, and d – base are some of the important softwares used for data processing, and drawing graphs and diagrams.
3267. MS Excel, being the most widely used and commonly available software program in all parts of the country, has been chosen among other software to carry out the data processing.
3268. Besides, it is also compatible with map-making software as one can easily feed data in MS Excel and attach it to the map making software to create maps.
3269. MS Excel is also called a spreadsheet programme.
3270. A spreadsheet is a rectangular table (or grid) to store information.
3271. The spreadsheets are located in Workbooks or Excel files.
3272. Most of the MS Excel screen is devoted to the display of the worksheet, which consists of rows and columns.
3273. The intersection of a row and column is a rectangular area, which is called a cell.
3274. In other words, a worksheet is made up of cells.
3275. A cell can contain a numerical value, a formula (which after calculation provides numerical value) or text.
3276. Texts are generally used for labelling numbers entered in the cells.
3277. A value entry can either be a number (entered directly) or result of a formula.
3278. The value of a formula will change when the components (arguments) of the formula change.
3279. The data entry and storing procedures are very simple in Excel.
3280. You can enter, copy and move any data from one cell to another and save them.
3281. You may also delete incorrect or unwanted data entry or a complete file, if it is not required for further use.
3282. The elementary functions of Excel that you would require for entering data and storing them are described in Table 4.1.
3283. You can learn more on your own by exploring other menus and options by yourself.
3284. Further, you will find it easier to feed data if you use the number pad given on the right side of your keyboard.
3285. For entering data column-wise, you need to press ‘enter key’ or ‘down arrow’ after typing a number.
3286. While row-wise pressing the right arrow key after typing a number can enter data.
3287. These operators that connect elements in a formula are solved in an order.
3288. The expressions enclosed in ‘brackets’ are solved first and are followed by the ‘exponents’, ‘division’, ‘multiplication’, ‘addition’ and ‘subtraction’.
3289. If you want to supplement your understanding of the percentage share of urban population to the total population, in that case, you have to calculate the percentage of urban population in various states of India.
3290. To do so, you will require the data on urban population and total population for each state of India.
3291. The worksheet allows you to easily calculate the percentage of urban population in each state provided you adopt the following steps :
3292. Now you need not to write the formula again for calculating the percentage of urban population for other states.
3293. Simply, click on the cell D2.
3294. This will copy the formula of the first state/cell to all the downward cells you have dragged it over.
3295. You have already been introduced to some basic statistical methods, such as measures of central tendency, dispersion and correlation in Chapter 2.
3296. You must have understood the concept and rationale behind these techniques.
3297. The use of worksheet functions to compute these statistics will be discussed in the subsequent paragraphs.
3298. In MS Excel, there are numerous inbuilt statistical and mathematical functions.
3299. These functions are located in the Insert menu.
3300. To use the function, click on the Insert menu, and choose f x (Function) from the dropdown list.
3301. Note that your cursor should be located in the cell where you want the formula to appear.
3302. Central tendencies are represented by mean, median and mode.
3303. Arithmetic mean, also called average, is a commonly used method for calculating the central tendency.
3304. In MS Excel, it is denoted by its popular name average.
3305. As an example, we shall calculate mean cropping intensity inIndia during various decades using the average function in Excel.
3306. Revolution” underwent a spatial spread and a tremendous increase in area under tube-well irrigation took place, which facilitated cultivation in the arid regions as well as during the dry seasons.
3307. Using almost the same procedure used for calculating mean, as outlined above, you can calculate median, standard deviation, and correlation.
3308. Some hints for this are provided in Fig.4.7 and Fig. 4.8.
3309. You know that the data in tabular form, at times make it difficult to draw inferences about whatever is being presented.
3310. On the other hand, the representation of the data in graphical form enhances our capabilities to make meaningful comparisons between the phenomena represented, and present a simplified view of the characteristics depicted.
3311. In other words, graphs and diagrams make us to decipher the contents of data easily.
3312. For example, it would be difficult to make sense of the Cropping Intensity in India if the data for all 50 years are presented in a tabular form.
3313. However, through a line graph or bar diagram, we can easily draw meaningful conclusions about the trend in Cropping Intensity in India.
3314. Time series data are represented through line graphs or bar diagrams.
3315. Bar diagrams and histograms are, generally, used for showing sharesor frequencies of various units.
3316. Compound bar diagrams, and pie charts are used for showing shares of various units
3317. Maps are used for location-wise representation of data. 
3318. This helps in comprehending spatial patterns in the data
3319. The selection of a suitable graphical method is important for the presentation of data.
3320. In Chapter 3, you have learnt about graphs and diagrams, and the kind of data suitable for.
3321. Here, you will learn how graphs and diagrams are constructed in Excel.
3322. Suppose, you want to represent changes in the share of workers in different industrial categories between 1981 and 2001, the most suitable graphical method would be a bar diagram as it shows changes over different years clearly.
3323. The construction of bar diagram requires the following steps :
3324. You can change the pattern of bars from colours to shades or vice versa by clicking on the bars.
3325. Similarly, you can also change the fonts or gridlines if required.
3326. The above diagram shows that the share of cultivators has declined significantly over the two decades and the share of other workers has appreciably risen and the shares of agricultural and household labourers have largely been the same.
3327. It should have a suitable title, in which time and space it relates to should also be mentioned.
3328. Within the title or as a sub-title, the unit in which the quantities are shown should be mentioned.
3329. The title, sub-title, title of axes, legend and the main presentation should be shown with suitable font size and type so that they occupy space in a balanced manner.
3330. The maps may also be drawn using a combination of computer hardware and the mapping software.
3331. The computer assisted mapping essentially requires the creation of a spatial database along with its integration with attribute or non- spatial data.
3332. it further involves the verification and structuring of the stored data.
3333. What is most important in this context is that the data must be geometrically registered to a generally accepted and properly defined coordinate system and coded so that they can be stored in the internal database structure within the computer.
3334. Hence, care must be taken while using the computer for mapping purposes.
3335. The spatial data represent a geographical space. They are characterised by the points, lines and polygons.
3336. The point data represent positional characteristics of some of the geographical features, such as schools, hospitals, wells, tube-wells, towns and villages, etc., on the map.
3337. In other words, if we want to present the occurrence of the
3338. objects on a map in dimensionless scale but with reference to location, we use points.
3339. Similarly, lines are used to depict linear features, like roads, railway lines, canals, rivers, power and communication lines, etc.
3340. Polygons are made of a number of inter-connected lines, bounding a certain area, and are used to show area features such as administrative units (countries, districts, states, blocks); land use types (cultivated area, forest lands, degraded/waste lands, pastures, etc.) and features, like ponds, lakes, etc.
3341. The data describing the information about spatial data are called non-spatial or attribute data.
3342. For example, if you have a map showing positional location of your school, you can attach the information, such as the name of the school, subject stream it offers, number of students in each class, schedule of admissions, teaching and examinations, available facilities, like library, labs, equipment, etc.
3343. In other words, you will be defining the attributes of the spatial data.
3344. Thus, non-spatial data are also known as attribute-data.
3345. The geographical data are available in analogue (map and aerial photographs) or digital form (scanned images).
3346. The procedure of creating spatial data in the computer has been discussed in Chapter 6.
3347. There are a number of commercially available mapping softwares, such as ArcGIS, ArcView, Geomedia, GRAM, Idrisi, Geometica, etc.
3348. There are also a few freely downloadable softwares that can be downloaded with the help of the Internet.
3349. However, it would be difficult to discuss the capabilities of each one of these softwares under the constraints of time and space.
3350. We will, therefore, describe the procedure in general used in choropleth mapping using a mapping software.
3351. A mapping software provides functions for spatial and attribute data input through onscreen digitisation of scanned maps, corrections of errors, transformation of scale and projection, data integration, map design, presentation and analysis.
3352. You can construct a choropleth map using any of the mapping software available to you, provided you follow the steps given in the user manual of the given software.
3353. If you experiment with the different options available in the software, you would be able to construct several types of maps using different methods.
3354. You must have seen graphs, diagrams and maps showing different types of data.
3355. For example, the thematic maps shown in Chapter 1 of book for Class XI entitled Practical Work in Geography, Part-I (NCERT, 2006) depict relief and slope, climatic conditions, distribution of rocks and minerals, soils, population, industries, general land use and cropping pattern in the Nagpur district, Maharashtra.
3356. These maps have been drawn using a large volume of related data collected, compiled and processed.
3357. Have you ever thought what would have happened if the same information would have been either in tabular form or in a descriptive transcript?
3358. Perhaps, it would not have been possible from such a medium of communication to draw visual impressions which we get through these maps.
3359. Besides, it would also have been a time consuming task to draw inferences about whatever is being presented in non–graphical form.
3360. Hence, the graphs, diagrams and maps enhance our capabilities to make meaningful comparisons between the phenomena represented, save our time and present a simplified view of the characteristics represented.
3361. In the present chapter, we will discuss methods of constructing different types of graphs, diagrams and maps.
3362. The data describe the properties of the phenomena they represent.
3363. They are collected from a variety of sources (Chapter 1).
3364. The geographers, economists, resource scientists and the decision makers use a lot of data these days.
3365. Besides the tabular form, the data may also be presented in some graphic or diagrammatic form.
3366. The transformation of data through visual methods like graphs, diagrams, maps and charts is called representation of data.
3367. Such a form of the presentation of data makes it easy to understand the patterns of population growth, distribution and the density, sex ratio, age–sex composition, occupational structure, etc.
3368. There is a Chinese proverb that ‘a picture is equivalent to thousands of words’. 
3369. Hence, the graphic method of the representation of data enhances our understanding, and makes the comparisons easy.
3370. Besides, such methods create an imprint on the mind for a longer time.
3371. Data represent various themes such as temperature, rainfall, growth and distribution of the population, production, distribution and trade of different commodities, etc.
3372. These characteristics of the data need to be suitably represented by an appropriate graphical method.
3373. For example, data related to the temperature or growth of population between different periods in time and for different countries/states may best be represented using line graphs.
3374. Similarly, bar diagrams are suited best for showing rainfall or the production of commodities.
3375. The population distribution, both human and livestock, or the distribution of the crop producing areas may suitably be represented on dot maps and the population density using choropleth maps.
3376. The scale is used as measure of the data for representation over diagrams and maps.
3377. Hence, the selection of suitable scale for the given data sets should be carefully made and must take into consideration entire data that is to be represented.
3378. The scale should neither be too large nor too small.
3379. We know that the design is an important cartographic task.
3380. (Refer ‘Essentials of Map Making’ as discussed in Chapter 1 of the Practical Work in Geography, Part-I (NCERT, 2006), a textbook of Class XI).
3381. The following components of the cartographic designs are important.
3382. Hence, these should be carefully shown on the final diagram/map.
3383. The title of the diagram/map indicates the name of the area, reference year of the data used and the caption of the diagram.
3384. These components are represented using letters and numbers of different font sizes and thickness.
3385. Besides, their placing also matters.
3386. Normally, title, subtitle and the corresponding year are shown in the centre at the top of the map/diagram
3387. A legend or index is an important component of any diagram/map.
3388. It explains the colours, shades, symbols and signs used in the map and diagram.
3389. It should also be carefully drawn and must correspond to the contents of the map/diagram.
3390. Besides, it also needs to be properly positioned.
3391. Normally, a legend is shown either at the lower left or lower right side of the map sheet.
3392. The maps, being a representation of the part of the earth’s surface, need to be oriented to the directions.
3393. Hence, the direction symbol, i. e. North, should also be drawn and properly placed on the final map.
3394. The data possess measurable characteristics such as length, width and volume.
3395. The diagrams and the maps that are drawn to represent these data related characteristics may be grouped into the following types:
3396. Plot the data to depict year/month-wise values according to the selected scale on Y-axis, mark the location of the plotted values by a dot and join these dots by a free hand drawn line.
3397. Polygraph is a line graph in which two or more than two variables are shown by an equal number of lines for an immediate comparison, such as the growth rate of different crops like rice, wheat, pulses or the birth rates, death rates and life expectancy or sex ratio in different states or countries.
3398. A different line pattern such as straight line ( ____ ), broken line (- - - ), dotted line (……) or a combination of dotted and broken line (-.-.-) or line of different colours may be used to indicate the value of different variables .
3399. A simple bar diagram is constructed for an immediate comparison.
3400. It is advisable to arrange the given data set in an ascending or descending order and plot the data variables accordingly.
3401. However, time series data are represented according to the sequencing of the time period.
3402. The line and bar graphs as drawn separately may also be combined to depict the data related to some of the closely associated characteristics such as the climatic data of mean monthly temperatures and rainfall.
3403. In doing so, a single diagram is drawn in which months are represented on X-axis while temperature and rainfall data are shown on Y-axis at both sides of the diagram.
3404. When different components are grouped in one set of variable or different variables of one component are put together, their representation is made by a compound bar diagram.
3405. In this method, different variables are shown in a single bar with different rectangles.
3406. Arrange the data in ascending or descending order.
3407. A single bar will depict the gross electricity generation in the given year and the generation of thermal, hydro and nuclear electricity be shown by dividing the total length of the bar as shown in Fig 3.7.
3408. Pie diagram is another graphical method of the representation of data.
3409. It is drawn to depict the total value of the given attribute using a circle.
3410. Dividing the circle into corresponding degrees of angle then represent the sub-sets of the data.
3411. Hence, it is also called Divided Circle Diagram.
3412. The angle of each variable is calculated using the following formulae.
3413. For example, a pie diagram may be drawn to show the total population of India along with the proportion of the rural and urban population.
3414. In this case, the circle of an appropriate radius is drawn to represent the total population and its sub-divisions into rural and urban population are shown by corresponding degrees of angle.
3415. Select a suitable radius for the circle to be drawn.
3416. A radius of 3, 4 or 5 cm may be chosen for the given data set.
3417. Draw a line from the centre of the circle to the arc as a radius.
3418. Measure the angles from the arc of the circle for each category of vehicles in an ascending order clockwise, starting with smaller angle.
3419. Complete the diagram by adding the title, sub-title, and the legend.
3420. The legend mark be chosen for each variable/category and highlighted by distinct shades/colours.
3421. The circle should neither be too big to fit in the space nor too small to be illegible.
3422. Starting with a bigger angle will lead to accumulation of error leading to the plot of the smaller angle being difficult.
3423. Flow chart is a combination of graph and map.
3424. It is drawn to show the flow of commodities or people between the places of origin and destination.
3425. It is also called Dynamic Map.
3426. Transport map, which shows the number of passengers, vehicles, etc., is the best example of a flow chart.
3427. These charts are drawn using lines of proportional width.
3428. Many government agencies prepare flow maps to show density of the means of transportation on different routes.
3429. The flow maps/ charts are generally drawn to represent two the types of data as given below:
3430. The number and frequency of the vehicles as per the direction of their movement.
3431. The number of the passengers and/or the quantity of goods transported.
3432. A route map depicting the desired transport routes along with the connecting stations.
3433. The data pertaining to the flow of goods, services, number of vehicles, etc., along with the point of origin and destination of the movements.
3434. The selection of a scale through which the data related to the quantity of passengers and goods or the number of vehicles is to be represented.
3435. Construct a flow map to represent the number of trains running in Delhi and the adjoining areas as given in the Table.
3436. Take an outline map of Delhi and adjoining areas, in which railway line and the nodal stations are depicted .
3437. Select a scale to represent the number of trains.
3438. Here, the maximum number is 50 and the minimum is 6.
3439. If we select a scale of 1cm = 50 trains, the maximum and minimum numbers will be represented by a strip of 10 mm and 1.2 mm thick lines, respectively, on the map.
3440. Plot the thickness of each strip of route between the given rail route.
3441. Graphs and diagrams serve a useful purpose in providing a comparison between the internal variations within the data of different characteristics represented.
3442. However, the use of graphs and diagrams, at times, fails to produce a regional perspective.
3443. Hence, variety of maps may also be drawn to understand the patterns of the regional distributions or the characteristics of variations over space.
3444. These maps are also known as the distribution maps.
3445. The thematic maps are, generally, classified into quantitative and non-quantitative maps.
3446. The quantitative maps are drawn to show the variations within the data.
3447. For example, maps depicting areas receiving more than 200 cm, 100 to 200 cm 50 to 100 cm and less than 50 cm of rainfall are referred to as quantitative maps.
3448. These maps are also called statistical maps.
3449. The non-quantitative maps, on the other hand, depict the non measurable characteristics in the distribution of given information, such as a map showing high and low rainfall receiving areas.
3450. These maps are also called qualitative maps.
3451. It would not be possible to discuss drawing these different types of thematic maps under the constraint of time.
3452. We will, therefore, confine to discuss the methods of the construction of the following types of quantitative maps :
3453. The dot maps are drawn to show the distribution of phenomena such as population, cattle, types of crops, etc.
3454. The dots of same size as per the chosen scale are marked over the given administrative units to highlight the patterns of distributions.
3455. An administrative map of the given area showing state/district /block boundaries.
3456. Statistical data on selected theme for the chosen administrative units, i.e., total population, cattle, etc.
3457. Selection of a scale to determine the value of a dot.
3458. Physiographic map of the region, especially relief and drainage maps.
3459. The lines, demarcating the boundaries of various administrative units, should not be very thick and bold.
3460. All dots should be of same size.
3461. Select the size and value of a dot.
3462. Determine the number of dots in each state using the given scale.
3463. For example, number of dots in Maharashtra will be 9,67,52,247/100,000 = 967.52. It may be rounded to 968, as the fraction is more than 0.5.
3464. Place the dots in each state as per the determined number in all states.
3465. Consult the physiographic/relief map of India to identify mountainous, desert, and/or snow covered areas and mark lesser number of dots in such areas.
3466. The choropleth maps are also drawn to depict the data characteristics as they are related to the administrative units.
3467. These maps are used to represent the density of population, literacy/growth rates, sex ratio, etc.
3468. Requirement for drawing Choropleth Map
3469. A map of the area depicting different administrative units.
3470. Appropriate statistical data according to administrative units.
3471. Arrange the data in ascending or descending order.
3472. Group the data into 5 categories to represent very high, high, medium, low and very low concentrations.
3473. The interval between the categories may be identified on the following formulae i.e., Range/5 and Range = maximum value – minimum value.
3474. Patterns, shades or colour to be used to depict the chosen categories should be marked in an increasing or decreasing order.
3475. Arrange the data in ascending order as shown above.
3476. Identify the range within the data. In the present case, the states recording the lowest and highest literacy rates are Bihar (47%) and Kerala (90.9%), respectively.
3477. Hence, the range would be 91.0 – 47.0 = 44.0
3478. Divide the range by 5 to get categories from very low to very high. (44.0/ 5 = 8.80. We can convert this value to a round number, i. e., 9.0
3479. Determine the number of the categories alongwith the range of each category.
3480. Add 9.0 to the lowest value of 47.0 as so on.
3481. Assign shades/pattern to each category ranging from lower to higher hues.
3482. Prepare the map as shown in Fig. 3.14.
3483. Complete the map with respect to the attributes of map design.
3484. We have seen that the data related to the administrative units are represented using choropleth maps.
3485. However, the variations within the data, in many cases, may also be observed on the basis of natural boundaries.
3486. For example, variations in the degrees of slope, temperature, occurrence of rainfall, etc. possess characteristics of the continuity in the data.
3487. These geographical facts may be represented by drawing the lines of equal values on a map.
3488. All such maps are termed as Isopleth Map.
3489. The word Isopleth is derived from Iso meaning equal and pleth means lines.
3490. Thus, an imaginary line, which joins the places of equal values, is referred as Isopleth.
3491. The more frequently drawn isopleths include Isotherm (equal temperature), Isobar (equal pressure), Isohyets (equal rainfall), Isonephs (equal cloudiness), Isohels (equal sunshine), contours (equal heights), Isobaths (equal depths), Isohaline (equal salinity), etc.
3492. Base line map depicting point location of different places.
3493. Appropriate data of temperature, pressure, rainfall, etc. over a definite period of time.
3494. Drawing instruments, especially French Curve, etc.
3495. An equal interval of values be selected.
3496. Interval of 5, 10, or 20 is supposed to be ideal.
3497. The value of Isopleth should be written along the line on either side or in the middle by breaking the line.
3498. Interpolation is used to insert the intermediate values between the observed values of at two stations/locations,
3499. such as temperature recorded at Chennai and Hyderabad or the spot heights of two points.
3500. Generally, drawing of isopleths joining the places of same value is also termed as interpolation.
3501. For interpolation, follow the following steps:
3502. Firstly, determine the minimum and maximum values given on the map.
3503. Calculate the range of value i.e. Range = maximum value – minimum value.
3504. Based on range, determine the interval in a whole number like 5, 10, 15, etc.
3505. The exact point of drawing an Isopleth is determined by using the following formulae.
3506. What is a thematic map?
3507. Differentiate between multiple bar diagram and compound bar diagram.
3508. What are the requirements to construct a dot map?
3509. Describe the method of constructing a traffic flow map.
3510. What is an Isopleth map ?
3511. How an interpolation is carried out?
3512. Describe and illustrate important steps to be followed in preparing a choropleth map.
3513. Discuss important steps to represent data with help of a pie diagram.
3514. Construct a multiple bar diagram to show the area under rice in each State.
3515. Construct a pie-diagram to show the percentage of area under rice in each State.
3516. Construct a dot map to show the production of rice in each State.
3517. Construct a Choropleth map to show the percentage of production of rice in States.
3518. Show the following data of temperature and rainfall of Kolkata with a suitable diagram.
3519. You have studied aspects of Physical Geography of the world, as well as, of India in Class XI.
3520. In the present class, besides the Practical Work in Geography you will study the various aspects of Human Geography.
3521. While studying these aspects,you may have observed that issues addressed pertain to global or national level.
3522. In other words, the given information helps us to understand the issues at macro level. 
3523. You may also have observed that the forms, events and processes in your surroundings are similar to what you have studied at macro level.
3524. Have you ever thought about how you would study some of the aspects at the local level?
3525. You know that regional level information is used to analyse different physical and human parameters of a large area.
3526. Similarly, information has to be gathered at the local level by conducting primary surveys for generating information.
3527. The primary surveys are also called field surveys.
3528. They are an essential component of geographic enquiry.
3529. It is a basic procedure to understand the earth as a home of humankind and are carried out through observation, sketching, measurement,interviews, etc. 
3530. In the present chapter, we will discuss the procedure involved in carrying out the field surveys.
3531. Like many other sciences, geography is also a field science.
3532. Thus, a geographical enquiry is always needed to be supplemented through a well-planned field survey.
3533. These surveys enhance our understanding about patterns of spatial distributions,their associations and relationships at the local level.
3534. Further, field surveys facilitate the collection of local level information that is not available through secondary sources.
3535. Thus, field surveys are carried out to gather required information so as the problem under investigation is studied in depth as per the predefined objectives.
3536. such studies also enable the investigator to comprehend the situation and processes in totality and at the place of their occurrence.
3537. This is possible through ‘observation’, which is a useful method of gathering information and then to derive inferences.
3538. The field survey is initiated with a well-defined procedure. It is performed in the following functionally interrelated stages
3539. The problem to be studied should be defined precisely.
3540. This can be achieved by way of statements indicating the nature of the problem.
3541. This should also be reflected in the title and sub-title of the topic of the survey.
3542. A further specification of the survey is done by listing the objectives.
3543. Objectives provide an outline of the survey and in accordance with these, suitable tools of acquisition of data and methods of analysis will be chosen.
3544. Like clearly defined objectives, scope of survey needs to be delimited in terms of geographical area to be covered, timeframe of enquiry and if required themes of studies to be covered.
3545. This multi-dimensional delimitation of the study is essential in relation to fulfilment of the predefined objectives and limitations of analysis, inferences and their applicability.
3546. Field survey is basically conducted to collect information about the chosen problem for which varied types of tools are required.
3547. These include secondary information, including maps and other data, field observation, data generated by interviewing people through questionnaires.
3548. These data provide base information about the problem.
3549. These are collected and published by different government agencies, organisations and other agencies.
3550. This information, alongwith cadastral and topographic maps, provides a basis to prepare the framework of survey.
3551. Listing of households, persons, landholdings in the survey area can be done using the official records or electoral rolls available with the village panchayat or the revenue officials. 
3552. Similarly, essential physical features, like relief, drainage, vegetation, land use and cultural features, like settlements, transport and communication lines, irrigation infrastructure, etc.
3553. The field boundaries of land parcels can be marked out from cadastral maps available with land revenue officials.
3554. The field survey is conducted either for the entire ‘population’ or for the samples’.these basic information and maps are required to select the units of observation
3555. The large-scale maps of the survey area also help the investigator to orient and locate him/her on the ground.
3556. This initial orientation helps the investigator to insert additional features in the map appropriately
3557. The effectiveness of field surveys is associated with the investigators’ capability to collect information about the landscape through observation.
3558. The very purpose of a field survey is to observe the characteristics and associations of geographic phenomena.
3559. To supplement the observation, certain techniques of acquisition of information are useful like that of sketching and photography.
3560. As you find sketches and photographs provided in your textbooks enhance your comprehension of facts, situations and processes being explained.
3561. Similarly, landscape scenarios can also be captured by photography of the landscape, objects and activities.
3562. At times, when a suitable large-scale map is not available, a sketch or a notional map of the survey area can be prepared based on reconnaissance surveys.
3563. This kind of exercise also helps in getting oneself introduced with the area as each feature needs to be observed carefully for locating them in the sketch.
3564. All the observations in the field are to be noted down for keeping a systematic record.
3565. Thus, using an appropriate scheme of categorising facts one should record relevant characteristics of objects.
3566. You cannot memorise everything you see, feel or understand.
3567.  While taking notes, a brief interaction with the people or with the members of the field party or referring to recorded information is always required for clarifications and unambiguous recording of observations.
3568. Some field surveys demand on site measurement of objects and events.
3569. This is all the more necessary when one wants to present the analysis with precision.
3570. It involves the use of appropriate equipment, which enables the investigator to measure the characteristics precisely.
3571. Thus, the field party should carry with them relevant equipment required to measure the selected features, such as measuring tape, weighing machine to weigh soil, pH meter or paper strip to measure the acidity or alkalinity and thermometer.
3572. In all field surveys dealing with social issues, information is gathered through personal interviews.
3573. Experiences and knowledge of each individual about his/her environs as well as about his/her own living are nothing but information.
3574. These experiences, if retrieved efficiently, are important sources of information.
3575. However, extraction of information through personal interviews is greatly influenced by an interviewer’s abilities in terms of understanding of the subject and the people to be interviewed, communicative skills and rapport with the people.
3576. Tools : Interviewing of people can be done either through pre-structured questionnaires and schedules or through participatory appraisal methods, like social and resource mapping and discussions.
3577. Basic Information : While conducting interviews as means of data collection, certain information like that of location, socio-economic background of the respondent are to be noted.
3578. On the basis of these parameters, an investigator categorises and compiles the information for further computations and analysis.
3579. Coverage : During field studies, an investigator has to decide whether the survey will be conducted in the form of a census for the entire population or will be based on a selected sample.
3580. If the study area is not very large but composed of diverse elements then the entire population should be surveyed.
3581. In the case of large size area, one can limit the study to selected samples representing all segments of the population.
3582. Units of Study : Elements of study need to be defined precisely alongwith the decision about census or sample survey.
3583. These elements consist of primary unit of observation, like households, parcels of land, business units, etc.
3584. Sample Design : A framework of sample survey, including its size and method of selecting samples is to be decided in relation to objectives of survey, variations in population and cost and time constraints.
3585. Cautions : Field interviews or participatory appraisal methods are highly sensitive activities and should be conducted with utmost sincerity and caution as one is dealing with human groups, which always do not share the cultural ethos and practices of the investigators.
3586. As a student of social science, you should be careful of the larger purpose of the study and should not stretch the argument beyond the scope of the study.
3587. To get the correct picture, your conversation and behaviour should reflect that you are one of them.
3588. While conducting the interview, ensure that no other person is intervening in your conversation either by his/her presence or by replying in between.
3589. You need to organise the information of varied types collected during the fieldwork for their meaningful interpretation and analysis to achieve the set objectives.
3590. Notes, field sketches, photographs, case studies, etc., are first organised according to sub-themes of the study.
3591. Similarly, questionnaire and schedule-based information should be tabulated either on a master sheet or on the spreadsheet.
3592. You have already learnt the features and use of spreadsheets. 
3593. You can even construct indicators and compute descriptive statistics.
3594. You have learnt different methods of mapping and drawing of diagrams and graphs and also use a computer in drawing them neatly and accurately.
3595. For getting visual impressions of variations in the phenomena, diagrams and graphs are very effective tools.
3596. Thus, the description and analysis should be duly supported by these presentations.
3597. The field study report in concise form should contain all the details of the procedures followed, methods, tools and techniques employed.
3598. The major part of the report will be devoted to the interpretation and analysis of information gathered and computed alongwith supportive facts in the form of tables, charts, statistical inferences, maps and references.
3599. The major part of the report will be devoted to the interpretation and analysis of information gathered and computed alongwith supportive facts in the form of tables, charts, statistical inferences, maps and references.
3600. At the end of the report, you should also provide the summary of the investigation.
3601. On the basis of the above outlines, you will select a problem or topic and carry out the fieldwork as a team of investigators in the supervision of your teacher.
3602. You know that field survey plays a significant role in understanding the forms, processes and events at a local level.
3603. A field survey may be conducted to study any issue of general concern.
3604. However, the selection of a topic for the case study depends upon the nature and character of the area where the survey is to be carried out.
3605. For example, in low rainfall and agriculturally less productive regions, droughts form a major topic of study.
3606. On the other hand, in States, like Assam, Bihar and West Bengal, which experience high rainfall conditions and occurrences of frequent floods during the rainy season necessitates a survey for the assessment of the damages caused by the floods.
3607. Similarly, a case study on air pollution emerges as a major topic near a smog-emitting industrial plant or a survey of the changing patterns of agricultural land use in Punjab and western Uttar Pradesh, which has drawn the benefits of the Green Revolution for several years becomes important.
3608. Similarly, a case study on air pollution emerging as a major topic near a smog-emitting industrial plant or a survey of the changing patterns of agricultural land use in Punjab and western Uttar Pradesh, which has drawn the benefits of the Green Revolution for several years becomes important.
3609. In the present chapter, we will discuss how specific case studies on droughts and poverty are conducted.
3610. The students should prepare a blueprint of the field survey in consultation with the class teacher to include details of the area to be visited, alongwith a map of the area, if available, clear understanding of the objectives of the survey and the well-structured questionnaire.
3611. The students should prepare a blueprint of the field survey in consultation with the class teacher to include details of the area to be visited, alongwith a map of the area, if available, clear understanding of the objectives of the survey and the well-structured questionnaire.
3612. The teacher should also give a few necessary instructions to the students.
3613. These include
3614. Be courteous to the people of the area you are visiting for the field survey.
3615. Develop a friendly attitude with the people you meet and establish rapport.
3616. Ask questions in comprehensible language.
3617. Avoid asking the questions that may either hurt the feelings of the people you are interviewing or those that may irritate them.
3618. Do not make any promises with the inhabitants of the area and do not tell lies about your purpose.
3619. Record each and every detail as given by the respondent of your queries and show them the recorded version, if asked for.
3620. Poverty denotes a state of people in terms of income, assets, consumption or nutrition at a given point of time.
3621. It is often understood and conveyed in the context of poverty line,
3622. which is a critical threshold level of income, consumption, access to productive resources and services below which people are classed as poor.
3623. The issue of poverty is closely linked with inequality, which is the cause of poverty.
3624. Poverty is, thus, not only an absolute but also a relative state.
3625. However, there is something absolute about it and despite the variations in regions and diversified society, people require adequate levels of food, clothing and shelter.
3626. Poverty can be either a chronic or temporary phenomena.
3627.  is more crucial to be understood.
3628. The chronic poverty, which is also known as structural poverty,
3629. Another significant aspect of poverty is that in spite of the high rate of economic growth more and more people are identified below the poverty line.
3630. It is rampant in both rural and urban areas alike.
3631. Thus, the dimensions of poverty and its measures could be studied through a field survey.
3632. To identify appropriate criteria to measure the poverty line.
3633. income, assets, expenditure, nutrition, resources picture poverty-stricken villages.
3634. And assessment of the level of welfare of the people on the basis of access to services.
3635. To explain the state of poverty with reference to the historical and structural conditions of the village and its inhabitants.
3636. To examine the implications of poverty.
3637. The spatial, temporal and thematic aspects of the survey can be understood clearly.
3638. In order to achieve the aforesaid objectives a field study may be conducted in a selected part of the rural or urban settlements.
3639. Spatially, it may cover an area of  hectares or more and inhabited by about  persons or  households.
3640. If the problem pertains to chronic poverty, the study should be based on average conditions or reflecting responses with references to normal rainfall year for the village as well as for the surrounding area.
3641. In case of temporary poverty, current year situations are to be investigated.
3642. Thematically, the study should cover household and individual level aspects like socio-demographic characteristics, permanent and consumer assets, income and expenditure, access to health, educational, transport and power services and infrastructure facilities to capture the targeted issues of status, determinants and implications of poverty.
3643. Before you proceed for field study, you should go through the literature on poverty and the region, in general, and the selected village, in particular.
3644. The conceptual aspects of poverty, like its meaning, measurement, criteria, causes, etc., can be understood through published work related to economic development, social changes and economic surveys.
3645. Basic population statistics can be obtained from district census handbooks or the village level primary census abstract, agricultural and livestock statistics can be acquired from village revenue officials or the Patwari Lekhpal, Karamchari, Karnain, etc.
3646. Household lists and other village level information can be collected from the Gram Panchayat office.
3647. Similarly, other relevant data are available with respective departments located at tehsil or block headquarters.
3648. All this information is essential to build the framework of the village resources and economy as well as to develop research design including sample design if the survey is not to be based on the entire population.
3649. As well as to develop research design including sample design if the survey is not to be based on the entire population.
3650. Topographic details, including relief, drainage, water bodies, settlements, means of communications and other topographical features of a village and its surrounding region are to be traced and studied from scale topographical maps.
3651. Similarly, the scale cadastral maps and revenue records of the villages may be obtained from the revenue officials.
3652. These maps provide a spatial dimension of inequality in land distribution if plotted by ownership of households.
3653. As a fundamental tool of field survey, much of the details of the poverty scenario can be visualised through keen observation.
3654. Observation of the routine activities of poverty-ridden people; quality and quantity of the food items; sources of fuel wood and drinking water; state of clothing and shelter, human sufferings associated with malnutrition, hunger, sickness, etc.; locational, social and political deprivations due to poverty and other pertinent attributes can be understood.
3655. These observations with aids, like photography, sketching, audio-visual recordings, etc., or just in the form of notes are valuable sources of non-quantifiable information to validate different points of views and to draw conclusions.
3656. In some situations, the actual measurement needs to be taken up.
3657. This is required in case of non-availability of data pertaining to quantity of food items consumed daily or the state of health in terms of height and weight, quality of drinking water or the nutritional value of different food items, availability of living space, etc
3658. Simpler means of measurement are fruitful in quantifying certain items precisely.
3659. Most poverty measures are based on aggregate household conditions.
3660. Have you ever thought about the most important factor which supports trees, grasses, crops and numerous life- forms over the earth’s surface?
3661. Can one grow a blade of grass without soil?
3662. While some plants and organisms which are aquatic in nature can sustain in water,
3663. do they not derive nutrients from soil through water?
3664. You will realise that soil is the most important layer of the earth’s crust.
3665. It is a valuable resource.
3666. The bulk of our food and much of our clothing is derived from land-based crops that grow in the soil.
3667. The soil on which we depend so much for our day-to-day needs has evolved over thousands of years.
3668. The various agents of weathering and gradation have acted upon the parent rock material to produce a thin layer of soil.
3669. Soil is the mixture of rock debris and organic materials which develop on the earth’s surface.
3670. The major factors affecting the formation of soil are relief,
3671. parent material, climate, vegetation and other life-forms and time.
3672. Besides these, human activities also influence it to a large extent.
3673. Components of the soil are mineral particles, humus, water and air
3674. The actual amount of each of these depends upon the type of soil.
3675. Some soils are deficient in one or more of these, while there are some others that have varied combinations
3676. Have you ever dug a pit in the field of your school to plant a tree while celebrating Van- Mahotsava?
3677. Was the pit a uniform layer of soil or did you notice different colours from the top to the bottom of the pit?
3678. If we dig a pit on land and look at the soil, we find that it consists of three layers which are called horizons.
3679. ‘Horizon A’ is the topmost zone
3680. where organic materials have got incorporated with the mineral matter, nutrients and water, which are necessary for the growth of plants.
3681. Horizon B’ is a transition zone between the ‘horizon A’ and ‘horizon C’, containing matter derived from below as well as from above.
3682. It has some organic matter.
3683. Although the mineral matter is noticeably weathered.
3684. Horizon C’ is composed of the loose parent material.
3685. This layer is the first stage in the soil formation process 
3686. Underneath these three horizons is the rock which is also known as the parent rock or the bedrock.
3687. Soil, which is a complex and varied entity, has always drawn the attention of the scientists.
3688. In order to understand its importance, it is essential to attempt a scientific study of the soil.
3689. Classification of the soil is an effort to achieve this objective.
3690. India has varied relief features, landforms, climatic realms and vegetation types.
3691. These have contributed to the development of various types of soils in India.
3692. In ancient times, soils used to be classified into two main groups – Urvara and Usara, which were fertile and sterile, respectively.
3693. In the 16th century A.D., soils were classified on the basis of their inherent characteristics and external features such as texture, colour, slope of land and moisture content in the soil.
3694. Based on texture, main soil types were identified as sandy, clayey, silt and loam, etc.
3695. On the basis of colour, they were red, yellow, black, etc.
3696. Since Independence, scientific surveys of soils have been conducted by various agencies.
3697. The Soil Survey of India, established in 1956, made comprehensive studies of soils in selected areas like in the Damodar Valley.
3698. The National Bureau of Soil Survey and the Land Use Planning Institute under the control of the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) did a lot of studies on Indian soils.
3699. In their effort to study soil and to make it comparable at the international level, the ICAR has classified the Indian soils on the basis of their nature
3700. character as per the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Soil Taxonomy.
3701. Alluvial soils are widespread in the northern plains and the river valleys.
3702. These soils cover about 40 per cent of the total area of the country.
3703. They are depositional soils, transported and deposited by rivers and streams.
3704. Through a narrow corridor in Rajasthan, they extend into the plains of Gujarat.
3705. In the Peninsular region, they are found in deltas of the east coast and in the river valleys.
3706. The alluvial soils vary in nature from sandy loam to clay.
3707. They are generally rich in potash but poor in phosphorus.
3708. In the Upper and Middle Ganga plain, two different types of alluvial soils have developed, viz. Khadar and Bhangar.
3709. Bhangar represents a system of older alluvium, deposited away from the flood plains.
3710. Both the Khadar and Bhangar soils contain calcareous concretions (Kankars).
3711. These soils are more loamy and clayey in the lower and middle Ganga plain and the Brahmaputra valley.
3712. The sand content decreases from the west to east.
3713. The colour of the alluvial soils varies from the light grey to ash grey.
3714. Its shades depend on the depth of the deposition, the texture of the materials, and the time taken for attaining maturity.
3715. Alluvial soils are intensively cultivated.
3716. Black soil covers most of the Deccan Plateau
3717. which includes parts of Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat, Andhra Pradesh and some parts of Tamil Nadu.
3718. In the upper reaches of the Godavari and the Krishna, and the north western part of the Deccan Plateau, the black soil is very deep.
3719. These soils are also known as the ‘Regur Soil’ or the ‘Black Cotton Soil’.
3720. The black soils are generally clayey, deep and impermeable.
3721. They swell and become sticky when wet and shrink when dried.
3722. shrink when dried.
3723. So, during the dry season, these soil develop wide cracks.
3724. Because of this character of slow absorption and loss of moisture, the black soil retains the moisture for a very long time
3725. which helps the crops, especially the rain fed ones, to sustain even during the dry season.
3726. Chemically, the black soils are rich in lime, iron, magnesia and alumina.
3727. They also contain potash.
3728. But they lack in phosphorus, nitrogen and organic matter.
3729. The colour of the soil ranges from deep black to grey.
3730. Red soil develops on crystalline igneous rocks in areas of low rainfall in the eastern and southern part of the Deccan Plateau.
3731. Along the piedmont zone of the Western Ghat, a long stretch of area is occupied by red loamy soil.
3732. Yellow and red soils are also found in parts of Odisha and Chhattisgarh and in the southern parts of the middle Ganga plain.
3733. The soil develops a reddish colour due to a wide diffusion of iron in crystalline and metamorphic rocks.
3734. It looks yellow when it occurs in a hydrated form.
3735. The fine-grained red and yellow soils are normally fertile,
3736. coarse-grained soils found in dry upland areas are poor in fertility.
3737. They are generally poor in nitrogen, phosphorus and humus.
3738. Laterite has been derived from the Latin word ‘Later’ which means brick.
3739. The laterite soils develop in areas with high temperature and high rainfall.
3740. With rain, lime and silica are leached away, and soils rich in iron oxide and aluminium compound are left behind.
3741. Humus content of the soil is removed fast by bacteria that thrives well in high temperatures.
3742. These soils are poor in organic matter, nitrogen, phosphate and calcium, while iron oxide and potash are in excess.
3743. laterites are not suitable for cultivation
3744. application of manures and fertilisers are required for making the soils fertile for cultivation
3745. Red laterite soils in Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh and Kerala are more suitable for tree crops like cashew nuts.
3746. Laterite soils are widely cut as bricks for use in house construction.
3747. These soils have mainly developed in the higher areas of the Peninsular plateau.
3748. The laterite soils are commonly found in Karnataka, Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Madhya Pradesh and the hilly areas of Odisha and Assam.
3749. Arid soils range from red to brown in colour.
3750. They are generally sandy in structure and saline in nature.
3751. In some areas, the salt content is so high that common salt is obtained by evaporating the saline water.
3752. Due to the dry climate, high temperature and accelerated evaporation, they lack moisture and humus.
3753. Nitrogen is insufficient and the phosphate content is normal.
3754. Lower horizons of the soil are occupied by ‘kankar’ layers because of the increasing calcium content downwards.
3755. Arid soils are characteristically developed in western Rajasthan, which exhibit characteristic arid topography.
3756. They are also known as Usara soils.
3757. Saline soils contain a larger proportion of sodium, potassium and magnesium,
3758. Thus, they are infertile, and do not support any vegetative growth.
3759. They have more salts, largely because of the dry climate and poor drainage.
3760. They occur in arid and semi-arid regions, and in waterlogged and swampy areas.
3761. Their structure ranges from sandy to loamy.
3762. Saline soils are more widespread in western Gujarat, deltas of the eastern coast and in Sundarban areas of West Bengal
3763. In the Rann of Kachchh, the Southwest Monsoon brings salt particles and deposits there as a crust. 
3764. Seawater intrusions in the deltas promote the occurrence of saline soils.
3765. In the areas of intensive cultivation with excessive use of irrigation, especially in areas of green revolution, the fertile alluvial soils are becoming saline
3766. Excessive irrigation with dry climatic conditions promotes capillary action 
3767. which results in the deposition of salt on the top layer of the soil.
3768. In such areas, especially in Punjab and Haryana, farmers are advised to add gypsum to solve the problem of salinity in the soil.
3769. They are found in the areas of heavy rainfall and high humidity, where there is a good growth of vegetation.
3770. Thus, large quantities of dead organic matter accumulates in these areas, and this gives a rich humus and organic content to the soil.
3771. Organic matter in these soils may go even up to 40-50 per cent.
3772. These soils are normally heavy and black in colour.
3773. At many places, they are alkaline also.
3774. It occurs widely in the northern part of Bihar, southern part of Uttarakhand and the coastal areas of West Bengal, Odisha and Tamil Nadu.
3775. As the name suggests, forest soils are formed in the forest areas where sufficient rainfall is available.
3776. The soils vary in structure and texture depending on the mountain environment where they are formed.
3777. They are loamy and silty on valley sides and coarse-grained in the upper slopes.
3778. In the snow-bound areas of the Himalayas, they experience denudation, and are acidic with low humus content.
3779. The soils found in the lower valleys are fertile
3780. It is evident from the foregoing discussions that soils, their texture, quality and nature are vital for the germination and growth of plant and vegetation including crops.
3781. Soils are living systems
3782. These have serious repercussions on other components of the system of which they themselves are important parts.
3783. In a broad sense, soil degradation can be defined as the decline in soil fertility
3784. The nutritional status declines and depth of the soil goes down due to erosion and misuse.
3785. Soil degradation is the main factor leading to the depleting soil resource base in India.
3786. The degree of soil degradation varies from place to place according to the topography, wind velocity and amount of the rainfall.
3787. The destruction of the soil cover is described as soil erosion.
3788. The soil forming processes and the erosional processes of running water and wind go on simultaneously.
3789. But generally, there is a balance between these two processes.
3790. The rate of removal of fine particles from the surface is the same as the rate of addition of particles to the soil layer.
3791. Sometimes, such a balance is disturbed by natural or human factors, leading to a greater rate of removal of soil.
3792. Human activities too are responsible for soil erosion to a great extent.
3793. As the human population increases, the demand on the land also increases.
3794. Forest and other natural vegetation is removed for human settlement, for cultivation, for grazing animals and for various other needs.
3795. Wind and water are powerful agents of soil erosion because of their ability to remove soil and transport it.
3796. Wind erosion is significant in arid and semi-arid regions.
3797. In regions with heavy rainfall and steep slopes, erosion by running water is more significant.
3798. Water erosion which is more serious and occurs extensively in different parts of India
3799. takes place mainly in the form of sheet and gully erosion.
3800. Sheet erosion takes place on level lands
3801. A region with a large number of deep gullies or ravines is called a badland topography.
3802. Ravines are widespread in the Chambal basin.
3803. Besides this, they are also found in Tamil Nadu and West Bengal.
3804. The country is losing about 8,000 hectares of land to ravines every year.
3805. What types are prone to gully erosion?
3806. Soil erosion is a serious problem for Indian agriculture
3807. Its negative effects are seen in other spheres also.
3808. Eroded materials are carried down to rivers and they lower down their carrying capacity
3809. cause frequent floods and damage to agricultural lands.
3810. Deforestation is one of the major causes of soil erosion.
3811. Plants keep soils bound in locks of roots, and thus, prevent erosion.
3812. They also add humus to the soil by shedding leaves and twigs
3813. Forests have been denuded practically in most parts of India but their effect on soil erosion are more in hilly parts of the country.
3814. A fairly large area of arable land in the irrigated zones of India is becoming saline because of over- irrigation
3815. The salt lodged in the lower profiles of the soil comes up to the surface and destroys its fertility.
3816. Chemical fertilisers are also harmful to the soil.
3817. Unless the soil gets enough humus, chemicals harden it and reduce its fertility in the long run.
3818. This problem is common in all the command areas of the river valley projects, which were the first beneficiaries of the Green Revolution.
3819. According to estimates, about half of the total land of India is under some degree of degradation.
3820. Every year, India loses millions of tonnes of soil and its nutrients to the agents of its degradation, which adversely affects our national productivity.
3821. So, it is imperative to initiate immediate steps to reclaim and conserve soils.
3822. If soil erosion and exhaustion are caused by humans; by corollary, they can also be prevented by humans.
3823. Nature has its own laws of maintaining balance.
3824. Nature offers enough opportunities for humans to develop their economy without disturbing the ecological balance.
3825. Soil conservation is a methodology to maintain soil fertility, prevent soil erosion and exhaustion, and improve the degraded condition of the soil.
3826. Soil erosion is essentially aggravated by faulty practices.
3827. The first step in any rational solution is to check open cultivable lands on slopes from farming.
3828. Lands with a slope gradient of 15 - 25 per cent should not be used for cultivation.
3829. If at all the land is to be used for agriculture, terraces should carefully be made.
3830. Over-grazing and shifting cultivation in many parts of India have affected the natural cover of land and given rise to extensive erosion.
3831. It should be regulated and controlled by educating villagers about the consequences.
3832. Contour bunding, Contour terracing, regulated forestry, controlled grazing, cover cropping, mixed farming and crop rotation are some of the remedial measures which are often adopted to reduce soil erosion.
3833. The Central Soil Conservation Board, set up by the Government of India, has prepared a number of plans for soil conservation in different parts of the country.
3834. These plans are based on the climatic conditions, configuration of land and the social behaviour of people.
3835. Integrated land use planning, seems to be the best technique for proper soil conservation.
3836. Lands should be classified according to their capability
3837. land use maps should be prepared and lands should be put to right uses
3838. The final responsibility for achieving the conservation of land will rest on the people who operate on it and receive the benefits
3839. Indira Gandhi Canal, previously known as the Rajasthan Canal, is one of the largest canal systems in India.        
3840. Conceived by Kanwar Sain in 1948, the canal project was launched on 31 March, 1958.        
3841. The canal originates at Harike barrage in Punjab and runs parallel to the Pakistan border at an average distance of 40 km in Thar Desert of Rajasthan.        
3842. The total planned length of the system is 9,060 km catering to the irrigation needs of a total culturable command area of 19.63 lakh hectares.        
3843. Out of the total command area, about 70 per cent was envisaged to be irrigated by flow system and the rest by lift system.        
3844. The construction work of the canal system has been carried out through two stages.        
3845. The command area of Stage-I lies in Ganganagar, Hanumangarh and northern part of Bikaner districts.        
3846. It has a gently undulating topography and its culturable command area is 5.53 lakh hectares.        
3847. The command area of Stage-II is spread over Bikaner, Jaisalmer, Barmer, Jodhpur, Nagaur and Churu districts covering culturable command area of 14.10 lakh hectares.        
3848. It comprises desert land dotted with shifting sand dunes and temperature soaring to 50°C in summers.        
3849. Irrigation in Stage-I command area of the canal was introduced in early 1960s, whereas, the command area of Stage-II began receiving irrigation in the mid-1980s.        
3850. The introduction of canal irrigation in this dry land has transformed its ecology, economy and society.        
3851. It has influenced the environmental conditions of the region both positively as well as negatively.        
3852. This has also helped in reducing wind erosion and siltation of canal systems.        
3853. But the intensive irrigation and excessive use of water has led to the emergence of twin environmental problems of waterlogging and soil salinity.        
3854. Introduction of canal irrigation has brought about a perceptible transformation in the agricultural economy of the region.        
3855. Soil moisture has been a limiting factor in successful growing of crops in this area.        
3856. But the spread of canal irrigation has led to an increase in cultivated area and intensity of cropping.        
3857. The traditional crops sown in the area, gram, bajra and jowar have been replaced by wheat, cotton, groundnut and rice.        
3858. This is the result of intensive irrigation.         
3859. This intensive irrigation, no doubt, initially has led to tremendous increase in agricultural and livestock productivity.        
3860. This has also caused waterlogging and soil salinity, and thus, in the long run, it hampers the sustainability of agriculture.        
3861. The ecological sustainability of the Indira Gandhi Canal Project has been questioned by various scholars.        
3862. It is a hard fact that attaining sustainable development in the command area requires major thrust upon the measures to achieve ecological sustainability.        
3863. Hence, five of the seven measures proposed to promote sustainable development in the command area are meant to restore ecological balance.        
3864. The first requirement is strict implementation of water management policy.        
3865. In general, the cropping pattern shall not include water intensive crops.        
3866. It shall be adhered to and people shall be encouraged to grow plantation crops such as citrus fruits.        
3867. The areas affected by water logging and soil salinity shall be reclaimed.        
3868. The eco-development through afforestation, shelterbelt plantation and pasture development is necessary particularly in the fragile environment of Stage-II.        
3869. The social sustainability in the region can be achieved only if the land allottees having poor economic background are provided adequate financial and institutional support for cultivation of land.        
3870. The economic sustainability in the region cannot be attained only through development of agriculture and animal husbandry.        
3871. The agricultural and allied activities have to develop alongwith other sectors of the economy.        
3872. This shall lead to diversification of economic base and establishment of functional linkages between basic villages, agro-service centres and market centres.        
3873. Over these long years, it has undergone many changes brought about primarily by the endogenic and exogenic forces.        
3874. These forces have played a significant role in giving shape to various surface and subsurface features of the earth.        
3875. Do you know that the Indian plate was to the south of the equator millions of years ago?        
3876. It was much larger in size and the Australian plate was a part of it.        
3877. Over millions of years, this plate broke into many parts and the Australian plate moved towards the southeastern direction and the Indian plate to the north.        
3878. Can you map different phases in the movement of the Indian plate?        
3879. This northward movement of the Indian plate is still continuing and it has significant consequences on the physical environment of the Indian subcontinent.        
3880. Can you name some important consequences of the northward movement of the Indian plate?        
3881. It is primarily through the interplay of these endogenic and exogenic forces and lateral movements of the plates that the present geological structure and geomorphologic processes active in the Indian subcontinent came into existence.        
3882. The northern boundary of the Peninsular Block may be taken as an irregular line running from Kachchh along the western flank of the Aravali Range near Delhi and then roughly parallel to the Yamuna and the Ganga as far as the Rajmahal Hills and the Ganga delta.        
3883. Apart from these, the Karbi Anglong and        
3884. The northeastern parts are the Meghalaya Plateau in the northeast and Rajasthan in the west are also extensions of this block.        
3885. In Rajasthan, the desert and other desert–like features overlay this block.        
3886. Since the Cambrian period, the Peninsula has been standing like a rigid block with the exception of some of its western coast which is submerged beneath the sea and some other parts changed due to tectonic activity without affecting the original basement.        
3887. As a part of the Indo-Australian Plate, it has been subjected to various vertical movements and block faulting.        
3888. The rift valleys of the Narmada, the Tapi and the Mahanadi and the Satpura block mountains are some examples of it.        
3889. The river valleys here are shallow with low gradients.        
3890. Can you calculate the gradient of the Himalayan and the Peninsular rivers and draw the comparisons?        
3891. Most of the east flowing rivers form deltas before entering into the Bay of Bengal.        
3892. The deltas formed by the Mahanadi, the Krishna, the Kaveri and the Godavari are important examples.        
3893. The Himalayas along with other Peninsular mountains are young, weak and flexible in their geological structure unlike the rigid and stable Peninsular Block.        
3894. These mountains are tectonic in origin, dissected by fast-flowing rivers which are in their youthful stage.        
3895. Various landforms like gorges, V-shaped valleys, rapids, waterfalls, etc. are indicative of this stage.        
3896. The third geological division of India comprises the plains formed by the river Indus, the Ganga and the Brahmaputra.        
3897. Originally, it was a geo-synclinal depression which attained its maximum development during the third phase of the Himalayan mountain formation approximately about 64 million years ago.        
3898. Since then, it has been gradually filled by the sediments brought by the Himalayan and Peninsular rivers.        
3899. Average depth of alluvial deposits in these plains ranges from 1,000-2,000 m.        
3900. The relief and physiography of India has been greatly influenced by the geological and geomorphological processes active in the Indian subcontinent.        
3901. ‘Physiography’ of an area is the outcome of structure, process and the stage of development.        
3902. The land of India is characterised by great diversity in its physical features.        
3903. The north has a vast expanse of rugged topography consisting of a series of mountain ranges with varied peaks, beautiful valleys and deep gorges.        
3904. The south consists of stable table land with highly dissected plateaus, denuded rocks and developed series of scarps.        
3905. In between these two lies the vast north Indian plain.        
3906. "The North and Northeastern Mountains consist of the Himalayas and the Northeastern hills.                                                                                                                                                                                                        "        
3907. "The Himalayas consist of a series of parallel mountain ranges.                                                                                                                                                                                                        "        
3908. Some of the important ranges are the Greater Himalayan range, which includes the Great Himalayas and the Shiwalik.        
3909. The Himalayas consist of a series of parallel mountain ranges.        
3910. Some of the important ranges are the Greater Himalayan range, which includes the Great Himalayas and Shiwalik.        
3911. The general orientation of these ranges is from northwest to the southeast direction in the northwestern part of India.        
3912. Himalayas in the Darjeeling and Sikkim regions lie in an east west direction, while in Arunachal Pradesh they are from southwest to the northwest direction.        
3913. In Nagaland, Manipur and Mizoram, they are in the north south direction.        
3914. The approximate length of the Great Himalayan range, also known as the central axial range, is 2,500 km from east to west, and their width varies between 160-400 km from north to south.        
3915. It is also evident from the map that the Himalayas stand almost like a strong and long wall between the Indian subcontinent and the Central and East Asian countries.        
3916. Himalayas are not only the physical barrier, they are also a climatic, drainage and cultural divide.        
3917. Can you identify the impact of the Himalayas on the geoenvironment of the countries of South Asia?        
3918. Can you find some other examples of similar geoenvironmental divides in the world?        
3919. There are large-scale regional variations within the Himalayas.        
3920. On the basis of relief. alignment of ranges and other geomorphological features, the Himalayas can be divided into the following subdivisions:        
3921. It comprises a series of ranges such as the Karakoram, Ladakh, Zaskar and Pir Panjal.        
3922. The northeastern part of the Kashmir Himalayas is a cold desert, which lies between the Greater Himalayas and the Karakoram ranges.        
3923. Between the Great Himalayas and the Pir Panjal range, les the world famous valley of Kashmir and the famous Dal Lake.        
3924. Important glaciers of South Asia such as the Baltoro and Slachen are also found in this region.        
3925. The Kashmir Himalayas are also famous for Karewa formations, which are useful Karewas Karewas for the cultivation of Zafran.        
3926. Some of the important other materials embedded with moraines. passes of the region are Zoji La on the Great Himalayas, Banihal on the Pir Panjal, Photu La on the Zaskar and Khardung La on the Ladakh range.        
3927. Some of the important fresh lakes such as Dal and Wular and salt water lakes such as Pangong Tso and Tso Moriri are also in this region.        
3928. This region is drained by the river Indus and its tributaries such as the Jhelum and the Chenab.        
3929. The Kashmir and northwestern Himalayas are well-known for their scenic beauty and picturesque landscape.        
3930. The landscape of the Himalayas is a major source of attraction for adventure tourists.        
3931. Do you know some famous places of pilgrimage such as Vaishno Devi, Amarnath Cave. Charar e-Sharif etc?        
3932. Srinagar, capital city of the union territory of Jammu and Kashmir is located on the banks of Jhelum river.        
3933. Dal Lake in Srinagar presents an interesting physical feature.        
3934. Jhelum in the valley of Kashmir is still in its youth stage and yet forms meanders-a typical feature associated with the mature stage in the evolution of fluvial Landform        
3935. The southernmost part of this region consists of longitudinal valleys known as 'duns'.        
3936. Jammu and Pathankot dun are important examples.        
3937. The Himachal and Uttarakhand Himalayas.        
3938. This part lies approximately between the Ravi in the west and the Kali in the east.        
3939. It is drained by two major river systems of India,i.e. the Indus and the Ganga.        
3940. This region is rich in biodiversity which has been preserved by the indigenous communities.        
3941. Due to rugged topography, the inter-valley transportation linkages are nominal.        
3942. Hence, most of the interactions are carried through the Duar region along the Arunachal-Assam border.        
3943. These are part of the Himalayan mountain system having their general alignment from the north to south direction.        
3944. They are known by different local names.        
3945. In the north, they are known as Patkai Bum, Naga hills, the Manipur hills and in the south as Mizo or Lushai hills.        
3946. These are low hills, inhabited by numerous tribal groups practising Jhum cultivation.        
3947. Most of these ranges are separated from each other by numerous small rivers.        
3948. The Barak is an important river in Manipur and Mizoram.        
3949. The physiography of Manipur is unique by the presence of a large lake known as ‘Loktak’ lake at the centre, surrounded by mountains from all sides.        
3950. Mizoram which is also known as the ‘Molasses basin’ which is made up of soft unconsolidated deposits.        
3951. Most of the rivers in Nagaland form the tributary of the Brahmaputra.        
3952. While two rivers of Mizoram and Manipur are the tributaries of the Barak river, which in turn is the tributary of Meghna;        
3953. The rivers in the eastern part of Manipur are the tributaries of Chindwin, which in turn is a tributary of the Irrawady of Myanmar.        
3954. The northern plains are formed by the alluvial deposits brought by rivers – the Indus,the Ganges and the Brahmaputra.        
3955. These plains extend approximately 3,200 km from the east to the west.        
3956. The average width of these plains varies between 150-300 km.        
3957. The maximum depth of alluvium deposits varies between 1,000-2,000 m.        
3958. From the north to the south, these can be divided into three major zones:         
3959. The alluvial plains can be further divided into the Khadar and the Bhangar.        
3960. Bhabar is a narrow belt ranging between 8-10 km parallel to the Shivalik foothills at the break-up of the slope.        
3961. As a result of this, the streams and rivers coming from the mountains deposit heavy materials of rocks and boulders.        
3962. South of the Bhabar is the Terai belt, with an approximate width of 10-20 km.        
3963. Most of the streams and rivers re-emerge without having any properly demarcated channel.        
3964. Thereby, creating marshy and swampy conditions known as the Tarai.        
3965. This has a luxurious growth of natural vegetation and houses a varied wildlife.        
3966. The south of Tarai is a belt consisting of old and new alluvial deposits known as the Bhangar and Khadar.        
3967. These plains have characteristic features of mature stages of fluvial erosional and depositional landforms such as sand bars, meanders, and braided channels.        
3968. Brahmaputra plains are known for their riverine islands and sandbars.        
3969. Most of these areas are subjected to periodic floods and shifting river courses forming braided streams.        
3970. The mouths of these mighty rivers also form some of the largest deltas of the world,like the Sunderbans delta.        
3971. Otherwise, this is a featureless plain with a general elevation of 50-150 m above the mean sea level.        
3972. The states of Haryana and Delhi form a water divide between the Indus and the Ganga river systems.        
3973. The Brahmaputra river flows from the northeast to the southwest direction.        
3974. But it takes an almost 90° southward turn at Dhubri before it enters into Bangladesh.        
3975. These river valley plains have a fertile alluvial soil cover.        
3976. Which supports a variety of crops like wheat, rice, sugarcane and jute, and hence, supports a large population.        
3977. Rising from the height of 150 m above the river plains up to an elevation of 600-900 m is the irregular triangle known as the Peninsular Plateau.        
3978. However, an extension of this is also seen in the northeast, in the form of Shillong and Karbi-Anglong plateau.        
3979. The Peninsular India is made up of a series of patland plateaus such as the Hazaribagh plateau, the Palamu plateau, the Ranchi plateau, the Malwa plateau, the Coimbatore plateau and the Karnataka plateau, etc.         
3980. This is one of the oldest and the most stable landmass of India.        
3981. The general elevation of the plateau is from the west to the east, which is also proved by the pattern of the flow of rivers.        
3982. Name some rivers of the Peninsular plateau which have their confluence in the Bay of Bengal and the Arabian sea.        
3983. Mention some landforms which are typical to the east flowing rivers but are absent in the west flowing rivers.        
3984. Some of the important physiographic features of this region are tors, block mountains, rift valleys, spurs, bare rocky structures, series of hummocky hills and wall-like quartzite dykes offering natural sites for water storage.        
3985. The western and northwestern part of the plateau has an empathic presence of black soil.        
3986. This Peninsular plateau has undergone recurrent phases of upliftment and submergence accompanied by crustal faulting and fractures.        
3987. These spatial variations have brought in elements of diversity in the relief of the Peninsular plateau.        
3988. The northwestern part of the plateau has a complex relief of ravines and gorges.        
3989. The ravines of Chambal, Bhind and Morena are some of the well-known examples.        
3990. On the basis of the prominent relief features, the Peninsular plateau can be divided into three broad groups.        
3991. The Deccan Plateau is bordered by the Western Ghats in the west, Eastern Ghats in the east and the Satpura, Maikal range and Mahadeo hills in the north.        
3992. Western Ghats are locally known by different names such as Sahyadri in Maharashtra, Nilgiri hills in Karnataka and Tamil Nadu and Anaimalai hills and Cardamom hills in Kerala.        
3993. Their average elevation is about 1,500 m with the height increasing from north to south.        
3994. Anamudi' (2,695 m), the highest peak of the Peninsular plateau, is located on the Anaimalai hills of the Western Ghats followed by Dodabetta (2.637 m) on the Nilgiri hills.        
3995. Most of the Peninsular rivers have their origin in the Western Ghats.        
3996. Eastern Ghats comprising the discontinuous and low hills are highly eroded by the rivers such as the Mahanadi, the Godavari, the Krishna, the Kaveri, etc.        
3997. Some of the important ranges include the Javadi hills. the Palconda range, the Nallamala hills, the Mahendragiri hills, etc.        
3998. The Eastern and the Western Ghats meet each other at the Nilgiri hills.        
3999. They are bounded to the west by the Aravali range.        
4000. The Satpura range is formed by a series of scarped plateaus on the south, generally at an elevation varying between 600-900 m above the mean sea level.        
4001. This forms the northernmost boundary of the Deccan plateau.        
4002. It is a classic example of the relict mountains which are highly denuded and form discontinuous ranges.        
4003. The extension of the Peninsular plateau can be seen as far as Jaisalmer in the West, where it has been covered by the longitudinal sand ridges and crescent-shaped sand dunes called barchans.        
4004. This region has undergone metamorphic processes in its geological history, which can be corroborated by the presence of metamorphic rocks such as marble, slate, gneiss, etc.        
4005. The general elevation of the Central Highlands ranges between 700-1.000 m above the mean sea level and it slopes towards the north and northeastern directions.        
4006. Most of the tributaries of the river Yamuna have their origin in the Vindhyan and Kaimur ranges.        
4007. Banas is the only significant tributary of the river Chambal that originates from the Aravalli in the west        
4008. An eastern extension of the Central Highland is formed by the Rajmahal hills, to the south of which lies a large reserve of mineral resources in the Chotanagpur plateau.        
4009. In fact it is an extension of the main Peninsular plateau.        
4010. It is believed that due to the force exerted by the northeastward movement of the Indian plate at the time of the Himalayan origin, a huge fault was created between the Rajmahal hills and the Meghalaya plateau.        
4011. Later, this depression got filled up by the deposition activity of the numerous rivers.        
4012. Today, the Meghalaya and Karbi Anglong plateau stand detached from the main Peninsular Block.        
4013. The Meghalaya plateau is further subdivided into three.        
4014. An extension of this is also seen in the Karbi Anglong hills of Assam.        
4015. Similar to the Chotanagpur plateau, the Meghalaya plateau is also rich in mineral resources like coal, iron ore, sillimanite, limestone and uranium.        
4016. This area receives maximum rainfall from the south west monsoon.        
4017. As a result, the Meghalaya plateau has a highly eroded surface.        
4018. To the northwest of the Aravali hills lies the Great Indian desert.        
4019. It is a land of undulating topography dotted with longitudinal dunes and barchans.        
4020. This region receives low rainfall below 150 mm per year:        
4021. Hence, it has an arid climate with low vegetation cover.        
4022. It is because of these characteristic features that this is also known as Marusthali.        
4023. It is believed that during the Mesozoic era, this region was under the sea.        
4024. This can be corroborated by the evidence available at wood fossils park at Aakal and marine deposits around Brahmsar, near Jaisalmer        
4025. Though the underlying rock structure of the desert is an extension of the Peninsular plateau, yet, due to extreme arid conditions.        
4026. Some of the well pronounced desert land features present here are mushroom rocks, shifting dunes and oasis.        
4027. On the basis of the orientation, the desert can be divided into two parts: the northern part is sloping towards Sindh and the southern towards the Rann of Kachchh.        
4028. The Luni river flowing in the southern part of the desert is of some significance.        
4029. Low precipitation and high evaporation makes it a water deficit region.        
4030. You have already read that India has a long coastline.        
4031. On the basis of the location and active geomorphological processes, it can be broadly divided into two: (i) the western coastal plains; (ii) the eastern coastal plains.        
4032. The western coastal plains are an example of submerged coastal plains.        
4033. It is believed that the city of Dwaraka which was once a part of the Indian mainland situated along the west coast is submerged under water.        
4034. Because of this submergence it is a narrow belt and provides natural conditions for the development of ports and harbours.        
4035. Kandla, Mazagaon, JLN port Navha Sheva, Marmagao. Mangalore, Cochin, etc. are some of the important natural ports located along the west coast.        
4036. The western coast may be divided into following divisions: the Kachchh and Kathiawar coast in Gujarat, Konkan coast in Maharashtra, Goan coast and Malabar coast in Karnataka and Kerala respectively.        
4037. The rivers flowing through this coastal plain do not form any delta.        
4038. The Malabar coast has got certain distinguishing features in the form of Kayals' (backwaters), which are used for fishing, inland navigation and also due to its special attraction for tourists.        
4039. Every year the famous Nehru Trophy Vallamkali (boat race) is held in Punnamada Kayal in Kerala.        
4040. As compared to the western coastal plain. the eastern coastal plain is broader and is an example of an emergent coast.        
4041. There are well developed deltas here, formed by the rivers flowing eastward into the Bay of Bengal.        
4042. These include the deltas of the Mahanadi, the Godavari, the Krishna and the Kaveri.        
4043. Because of its emergent nature, it has less number of ports and harbours.        
4044. On 26 December 2004, the Andaman and Nicobar Islands experienced one of the most devastating natural calamities.        
4045. Can you name the calamity and identify some other areas which were adversely affected by the same calamity? What was its major consequence?        
4046. The continental shelf ved that extends up to 500 km into the sea, which makes it difficult for the development of good west ports and harbours.        
4047. There are two major island groups in India - one in the Bay of Bengal and the other in the Arabian Sea.        
4048. The Bay of Bengal island groups consist of about 572 islands/islets.        
4049. These are situated roughly between 6°N-14°N and 92°E -94°E.        
4050. The two principal groups of islets include the Ritchie's archipelago and the Labyrinth island.        
4051. The entire group of islands is divided into two broad categories - the andaman in the north and the nicobar in the south.        
4052. It is believed that these islands are an elevated portion of submarine mountains.        
4053. Some smaller islands are volcanic in origin.        
4054. Barren island, the only active volcano in India is also situated in the Nicobar islands.        
4055. The coastal line has some coral deposits. and beautiful beaches.        
4056. These islands receive convectional rainfall and have an equatorial type of vegetation.        
4057. The islands of the Arabian sea include Lakshadweep and Minicoy.        
4058. These are scattered between 80°N-12°N and 71°E -74°E longitude.        
4059. These islands are located at a distance of 280 km-480 km off the Kerala coast.        
4060. The entire island group is built of coral deposits.        
4061. There are approximately 36 islands of which 11 are inhabited.        
4062. Minicoy is the largest island with an area of 453 sq. km.        
4063. The entire group of islands is broadly divided by the Ten degree channel, north of which is the Amini Island and to the south of the Cannanore Island.        
4064. The Islands of this archipelago have storm beaches consisting of unconsolidated pebbles, shingles, cobbles and boulders on the eastern seaboard.        
4065. In which part of the Himalayas do we find the Karewa formation?        
4066. In which of the following states is Loktak lake situated?        
4067. Which one of the water bodies separates the Andaman from the Nicobar?        
4068. On which of the following hill ranges is the Doddabetta' peak situated?        
4069. If a person is to travel to Lakshadweep, from which coastal plain does he prefer and why?        
4070. Where in India will you find a cold desert?         
4071. Name some important ranges of this region.        
4072. Why is the western coastal plain devoid of any delta?        
4073. Make a comparison of the island groups of the Arabian Sea and the Bay of Bengal.        
4074. What are the important geomorphological features found in the river valley plains?        
4075. If you move from Badrinath to Sunderbans delta along the course of the river Ganga, what major geomorphological features will you come across?        
4076. Make a list of major Himalayan peaks from the west to the east with the help        
4077. Identify the major landforms of your state and analyse the major economic activity practised by the people in each landform.        
4078. English        
4079. In the Himalayan reaches, the course of these rivers is highly tortuous, but over the plains they display a strong meandering tendency and shift their courses frequently.        
4080. River Kosi, also known as the ‘sorrow of Bihar’, has been notorious for frequently changing its course.        
4081. This river brings huge quantity of sediments from its upper reaches and deposits it in the plains.        
4082. The course gets blocked, and consequently, the river changes its course.        
4083. Why does the Kosi river bring such a huge quantity of sediments from the upper reaches?        
4084. Do you think that the discharge of the water in the rivers in general and the Kosi in particular, remains the same, or does it fluctuate?        
4085. When does the river course receive the maximum quantity of water?        
4086. What are the positive and negative effects of flooding?        
4087. There are differences of opinion about the evolution of the Himalayan rivers.        
4088. However, geologists believe that a mighty river called Shiwalik or Indo-Brahma traversed the entire longitudinal extent of the Himalaya from Assam to Punjab and onwards to Sind, and finally discharged into the Gulf of Sind near lower Punjab during the Miocene period some 5-24 million years ago.        
4089. The remarkable continuity of the Shiwalik and its lacustrine origin and alluvial deposits consisting of sands, silt, clay, boulders and conglomerates support this viewpoint.        
4090. It is opined that in due course of time Indo– Brahma river was dismembered into three main drainage systems.        
4091. The Indus and its five tributaries in the western part.        
4092. The Ganga and its Himalayan tributaries in the central part.        
4093. The stretch of the Brahmaputra in Assam and its Himalayan tributaries in the eastern part.        
4094. The dismemberment was probably due to the Pleistocene upheaval in the western Himalayas, including the uplift of the Potwar Plateau, which acted as the water divide between the Indus and Ganga drainage systems.        
4095. Likewise, the down- thrusting of the Malda gap area between the Rajmahal hills and the Meghalaya plateau during the mid-pleistocene period, diverted the Ganga and the Brahmaputra systems to flow towards the Bay of Bengal.        
4096. The Himalayan drainage consists of several river systems but the following are the major river systems.        
4097. The Indus, also known as the Sindhu, is the westernmost of the Himalayan rivers in India.        
4098. It originates from a glacier near Bokhar Chu in the Tibetan region at an altitude of 4,164 m in the Kailash Mountain range.        
4099. In Tibet, it is known as ‘Singi Khamban; or Lion’s mouth.        
4100. After flowing in the northwest direction between the Ladakh and Zanskar ranges, it passes through Ladakh and Baltistan.        
4101. It cuts across the Ladakh range, forming a spectacular gorge near Gilgit in Jammu and Kashmir.        
4102. It enters into Pakistan near Chilas in the Dardistan region.        
4103. Find out the area known as Dardistan.        
4104. The Indus receives a number of Himalayan tributaries such as the Shyok, the Gilgit, the Zaskar, the Hunza, the Nubra, the Shigar, the Gasting and the Dras.        
4105. It finally emerges out of the hills near Attock where it receives the Kabul river on its right bank.        
4106. The other important tributaries joining the right bank of the Indus are the Khurram, the Tochi, the Gomal, the Viboa and the Sangar.        
4107. They all originate in the Sulaiman ranges.        
4108. The Panjnad is the name given to the five rivers of Punjab, namely the Satluj, the Beas, the Ravi, the Chenab and the Jhelum.        
4109. It finally discharges into the Arabian Sea, east of Karachi.        
4110. The Indus flows in India only through Jammu and Kashmir.        
4111. The Jhelum, an important tributary of the Indus, rises from a spring at Verinag situated at the foot of the Pir Panjal in the south-eastern part of the valley of Kashmir.        
4112. It flows through Srinagar and the Wular lake before entering Pakistan through a deep narrow gorge, It joins the Chenab near Jhang in Pakistan.        
4113. The Chenab is the largest tributary of the Indus.        
4114. It is formed by two streams, the Chandra and the Bhaga, which join at Tandi near Keylong in Himachal Pradesh.        
4115. Hence, it is also known as Chandrabhaga.        
4116. The river flows for 1,180 km before entering into Pakistan.        
4117. The Ravi is another important tributary of the Indus.        
4118. It rises west of the Rohtang pass in the Kullu hills of Himachal Pradesh and flows through the Chamba valley of the state.        
4119. Before entering Pakistan and joining the Chenab near Sarai Sidhu, it drains the area lying between the southeastern part of the Pir Panjal and the Dhauladhar ranges.        
4120. The Beas is another important tributary of the Indus, originating from the Beas Kund near the Rohtang Pass at an elevation of 4,000 m above the mean sea level.        
4121. The river flows through the Kullu valley and forms gorges at Kati and Largi in the Dhauladhar range.        
4122. It enters the Punjab plains where it meets the Satluj near Harike.        
4123. The Satluj originates in the ‘Raksas tal’ near Mansarovar at an altitude of 4,555 m in Tibet where it is known as Langchen Khambab.        
4124. It flows almost parallel to the Indus for about 400 km before entering India, and comes out of a gorge at Rupar.        
4125. It passes through the Shipki La on the Himalayan ranges and enters the Punjab plains.        
4126. It is an antecedent river.        
4127. It is a very important tributary as it feeds the canal system of the Bhakra Nangal project.        
4128. The Ganga is the most important river of India both from the point of view of its basin and cultural significance.        
4129. It rises in the Gangotri glacier near Gaumukh (3,900 m) in the Uttarkashi district of Uttarakhand.        
4130. Here, it is known as the Bhagirathi.         
4131. It cuts through the Central and the Lesser Himalayas in narrow gorges.        
4132. At Devprayag, the Bhagirathi meets the Alaknanda; hereafter, it is known as the Ganga.        
4133. The Alaknanda has its source in the Satopanth glacier above Badrinath.        
4134. The Alaknanda consists of the Dhauli and the Vishnu Ganga which meet at Joshimath or Vishnu Prayag.        
4135. The other tributaries of Alaknanda such as the Pindar joins it at Karna Prayag while Mandakini or Kali Ganga meets it at Rudra Prayag.        
4136. The Ganga enters the plains at Haridwar.        
4137. From here, it flows first to the south, then to the south-east and east before splitting into two distributaries, namely the Bhagirathi and the Padma.        
4138. India is endowed with a rich variety of mineral resources due to its varied geological structure.
4139. Bulk of the valuable minerals are products of pre-palaezoic age and are mainly associated with metamorphic and igneous rocks of the peninsular India.
4140. The vast alluvial plain tract of north India is devoid of minerals of economic use.
4141. The mineral resources provide the country with the necessary base for industrial development.
4142. In this chapter, we shall discuss the availability of various types of mineral and energy resources in the country.
4143. On the basis of chemical and physical properties, minerals may be grouped under two main categories of metallics and non-metallics which may further be classified as follows
4144. As, it is clear from the metallic minerals are the sources of metals.
4145. Iron ore, copper, gold produce metal and are included in this category.
4146. Metallic minerals are further divided into ferrous and non-ferrous metallic minerals.
4147. Ferrous, as you know, refers to iron.
4148. All those minerals which have iron content are ferrous such as iron ore itself and those which do not have iron content are non-ferrous such as copper, bauxite, etc.
4149. Non-metallic minerals are either organic in origin such as fossil fuels also known as mineral fuels which are derived from the buried animal and plant life such as coal and petroleum.
4150. Other type of non-metallic minerals are inorganic in origin such as mica, limestone and graphite, etc.
4151. Minerals have certain characteristics.
4152. These are unevenly distributed over space.
4153. There is inverse relationship in quality and quantity of minerals i.e. good quality minerals are less in quantity as compared to low quality minerals.
4154. The third main characteristic is that all minerals are exhaustible over time.
4155. These take long to develop geologically and they cannot be replenished immediately at the time of need.
4156. Thus, they have to be conserved and not misused as they do not have the second crop.
4157. Most of the metallic minerals in India occur in the peninsular plateau region in the old crystalline rocks.
4158. Over 97 per cent of coal reserves occur in the valleys of Damodar, Sone, Mahanadi and Godavari.
4159. Petroleum reserves are located in the sedimentary basins of Assam, Gujarat and Mumbai High i.e. off-shore region in the Arabian Sea.
4160. New reserves have been located in the Krishna-Godavari and Kaveri basins.
4161. Most of the major mineral resources occur to the east of a line linking Mangaluru and Kanpur.
4162. Minerals are generally concentrated in three broad belts in India.
4163. There may be some sporadic occurrences here and there in isolated pockets.
4164. These belts are :
4165. The North-Eastern Plateau Region
4166. This belt covers Chhotanagpur (Jharkhand), Odisha Plateau, West Bengal and parts of Chhattisgarh.
4167. Have you ever thought about the reason of major iron and steel industry being located in this region?
4168. It has variety of minerals viz. iron ore coal, manganese, bauxite, mica.
4169. The South-Western Plateau Region
4170. This belt extends over Karnataka, Goa and contiguous Tamil Nadu uplands and Kerala.
4171. This belt is rich in ferrous metals and bauxite.
4172. It also contains high grade iron ore, manganese and limestone.
4173. This belt lacks in coal deposits except Neyveli lignite.
4174. This belt does not have as diversified mineral deposits as the north-eastern belt.
4175. Kerala has deposits of monazite and thorium, bauxite clay.

4211. Maharashtra is also an important producer of manganese.
4212. Here, manganese is mined in Nagpur, Bhandara and Ratnagiri districts.
4213. The disadvantage to these mines is that they are located far from steel plants.
4214. The manganese belt of Madhya Pradesh extends in a belt in Balaghat-Chhindwara-Nimar-Mandla and Jhabua districts.
4215. Telangana, Goa, and Jharkhand are other minor producers of manganese.
4216. India is poorly endowed with non-ferrous metallic minerals except bauxite.
4217. Bauxite is the ore, which is used in manufacturing of aluminium.
4218. Bauxite is found mainly in tertiary deposits and is associated with laterite rocks occurring extensively either on the plateau or hill ranges of peninsular India and also in the coastal tracts of the country.
4219. Odisha happens to be the largest produce of Bauxite.

4230. It is also mixed with gold to provide strength to jewellery.
4231. The Copper deposits mainly occur in Singhbhum district in Jharkhand, Balaghat district in Madhya Pradesh and Jhunjhunu and Alwar districts in Rajasthan.
4232. Minor producers of Copper are Agnigundala in Guntur District (Andhra Pradesh), Chitradurg and Hasan districts (Karnataka) and South Arcot district (Tamil Nadu).
4233. Among the non-metallic minerals produced in India, mica is the important one.
4234. The other minerals extracted for local consumption are limestone, dolomite and phosphate.
4235. Mica is mainly used in the electrical and electronic industries.
4236. It can be split into very thin sheets which are tough and flexible.
4237. Mica in India is produced in Jharkhand, Andhra Pradesh, Telanganga and Rajasthan followed by Tamil Nadu, West Bengal and Madhya Pradesh.
4238. In Jharkhand, high quality mica is obtained in a belt extending over a distance of about 150 km, in length and about 22 km, in width in lower Hazaribagh plateau.
4239. In Andhra Pradesh, Nellore district produces the best quality mica.
4240. In Rajasthan, mica belt extends for about 320 kms from Jaipur to Bhilwara and around Udaipur.

4242. Mineral fuels are essential for generation of power, required by agriculture, industry, transport and other sectors of the economy.
4243. Mineral fuels like coal, petroleum and natural gas (known as fossil fuels), nuclear energy minerals, are the conventional sources of energy.
4244. These conventional sources are exhaustible resources.
4245. Coal is a one of the important minerals which is mainly used in the generation of thermal power and smelting of iron ore.
4246. Coal occurs in rock sequences mainly of two geological ages, namely Gondwana and tertiary deposits.
4247. About 80 per cent of the coal deposits in India is of bituminous type and is of non-coking grade.
4248. The most important Gondwana coal fields of India are located in Damodar Valley.
4249. They lie in Jharkhand-Bengal coal belt and the important coal fields in this region are Raniganj, Jharia, Bokaro, Giridih, Karanpura.
4250. Jharia is the largest coal field followed by Raniganj.
4251. The other river valleys associated with coal are Godavari, Mahanadi and Sone.
4252. The most important coal mining centres are Singrauli in Madhya Pradesh, Korba in Chhattisgarh, Talcher and Rampur in Odisha, Chanda–Wardha, Kamptee and Bander in Maharashtra and Singareni in Telangana and Pandur in Andhra Pradesh.
4253. Tertiary coals occur in Assam, Arunachal Pradesh, Meghalaya and Nagaland.
4254. It is extracted from Darangiri, Cherrapunji, Mewlong and Langrin; Makum, Jaipur and Nazira in upper Assam, Namchik – Namphuk and Kalakot .
4255. Besides, the brown coal or lignite occur in the coastal areas of Tamil Nadu, Puducherry, Gujarat and Jammu and Kashmir.
4256. Crude petroleum consists of hydrocarbons of liquid and gaseous states varying in chemical composition, colour and specific gravity.
4257. It is an essential source of energy for all internal combustion engines in automobiles, railways and aircraft.
4258. Its numerous by-products are processed in petrochemical industries, such as fertiliser, synthetic rubber, synthetic fibre, medicines, vaseline, lubricants, wax, soap and cosmetics.
4259. Crude petroleum occurs in sedimentary rocks of the tertiary period.
4260. Oil exploration and production was systematically taken up after the Oil and Natural Gas Commission was set up in 1956.
4261. Till then, Digboi in Assam was the only oil producing region but the scenario changed after 1956.
4262. In recent years, new oil deposits have been found at the extreme western and eastern parts of the country.
4263. In Assam, Digboi, Naharkatiya and Moran are important oil producing areas.
4264. The major oilfields of Gujarat are Ankaleshwar,Kalol, Mehsana, Nawagam, Kosamba and Lunej.
4265. Mumbai High which lies 160 km off Mumbai was discovered in 1973 and production commenced in 1976.
4266. Oil and natural gas have been found in exploratory well in Krishna-Godavari and Kaveri basin on the east coast.
4267. Oil extracted from the wells is crude oil and contains many impurities.
4268. It cannot be used directly.
4269. It needs to be refined.
4270. these are two types of refineries in India: field-based and market-based.
4271. Digboi is an example of field-based and Barauni is an example of market-based refinery
4272. The Gas Authority of India Limited was set up in 1984 as a public sector undertaking to transport and market natural gas.
4273. It is obtained along with oil in all the oilfields
4274.  but exclusive reserves have been located along the eastern coast as well as Tripura, Rajasthan and off-shore wells in Gujarat and Maharashtra.
4275. Fossil fuel sources, such as coal, petroleum, natural gas and nuclear energy use exhaustible raw materials.
4276. Sustainable energy resources are only the renewable energy sources like solar, wind, hydrogeothermal and biomass.
4277. These energy sources are more equitably distributed and environment-friendly.
4278. The non-conventional energy sources will provide more sustained, eco-friendly cheaper energy after the initial cost is taken care of
4279. Nuclear energy has emerged as a viable source in recent times.
4280. Important minerals used for the generation of nuclear energy are uranium and thorium.
4281. Uranium deposits occur in the Dharwar rocks.
4282. Geographically, uranium ores are known to occur in several locations along the Singbhum Copper belt.
4283. It is also found in Udaipur, Alwar and Jhunjhunu districts of Rajasthan, Durg district of Chhattisgarh, Bhandara district of Maharashtra and Kullu district of Himachal Pradesh.
4284. Thorium is mainly obtained from monazite and ilmenite in the beach sands along the coast of Kerala and Tamil Nadu.
4285. World’s richest monazite deposits occur in Palakkad and Kollam districts of Kerala, near Vishakhapatnam in Andhra Pradesh and Mahanadi river delta in Odisha.
4286. Atomic Energy Commission was established in 1948, progress could be made only after the establishment of the Atomic Energy Institute at Trombay in 1954 which was renamed as the Bhabha Atomic Research Centre in 1967.
4287. The important nuclear power projects are Tarapur, Rawatbhata near Kota, Kalpakkam, Narora , Kaiga and Kakarapara.
4288. Sun rays tapped in photovoltaic cells can be converted into energy, known as solar energy.
4289. The two effective processes considered to be very effective to tap solar energy are photovoltaics and solar thermal technology.
4290. Solar thermal technology has some relative advantages over all other non-renewable energy sources.
4291. It is cost competitive, environment friendly and easy to construct.
4292. Solar energy is 7 per cent more effective than coal or oil based plants and 10 per cent more effective than nuclear plants.
4293. It is generally used more in appliances like heaters, crop dryers, cookers, etc.
4294. The western part of India has greater potential for the development of solar energy in Gujarat and Rajasthan.
4295. Wind energy is absolutely pollution free, inexhaustible source of energy.
4296. The mechanism of energy conversion from blowing wind is simple.
4297. The kinetic energy of wind, through turbines is converted into electrical energy.
4298. The permanent wind systems such the trade winds, westerlies and seasonal wind like monsoon have been used as source of energy.
4299. Besides these, local winds, land and sea breezes can also be used to produce electricity.
4300. India, already has started generating wind energy.
4301. In Rajasthan, Gujarat, Maharashtra and Karnataka, favourable conditions for wind energy exist.
4302. Ocean currents are the store-house of infinite energy.
4303. Since the beginning of seventeenth and eighteenth century, persistent efforts were made to create a more efficient energy system from the ceaseless tidal waves and ocean current.
4304. Large tidal waves are known to occur along the west coast of India.
4305. Hence, India has great potential for the development of tidal energy along the coasts but so far these have not yet been utilised.
4306. When the magma from the interior of earth,comes out on the surface, tremendous heat is released.
4307. This heat energy can successfully be tapped and converted to electrical energy.
4308. Apart from this, the hot water that gushes out through the geyser wells is also used in the generation of thermal energy.
4309. It is popularly known as Geothermal energy.
4310. This energy is now considered to be one of the key energy sources which can be developed as an alternate source.
4311. The hot springs and geysers are being used since medieval period.
4312. In India, a geothermal energy plant has been commissioned at Manikaran in Himachal Pradesh.
4313. Bio-energy refers to energy derived from biological products which includes agricultural residues, municipal, industrial and other wastes.
4314. Bio-energy is a potential source of energy conversion.
4315. It can be converted into electrical energy, heat energy or gas for cooking.
4316. It will also process the waste and garbage and produce energy.
4317. This will improve economic life of rural areas in developing countries, reduce environmental pollution, enhance self-reliance and reduce pressure on fuel wood.
4318. One such project converting municipal waste into energy is Okhla in Delhi.
4319. Conservation of Mineral Resources
4320. The challenge of sustainable development requires integration of quest for economic development with environmental concerns.
4321. Traditional methods of resource use result into generating enormous quantity of waste as well as create other environmental problems.
4322. Hence, for sustainable development calls for the protection of resources for the future generations.
4323. There is an urgent need to conserve the resources.
4324. The alternative energy sources like solar power, wind, wave, geothermal energy are inexhaustible resource.
4325. These should be developed to replace the exhaustible resources In case of metallic minerals, use of scrap metals will enable recycling of metals.
4326. Use of scrap is specially significant in metals like copper, lead and zinc in which India’s reserves are meagre.
4327. Use of substitutes for scarce metals may also reduce their consumption.
4328. Export of strategic and scarce minerals must be reduced, so that the existing reserve may be used for a longer period.
4329. You might have read about tsunami or seen the images of horror on television set immediately after it happened.                                
4330. You may also be aware of the severe earthquake in Kashmir on both sides of the Line of Control (LOC).                                
4331. The damage caused to human life and properties during these episodes has moved us all.                                
4332. What are these as phenomena and how they are caused?                                
4333. How can we save ourselves?                                
4334. These are some questions which come to our minds.                                
4335. This chapter will attempt to analyse some of these questions.                                
4336. Change is the law of nature.                                
4337. It is a continuous process that goes on uninterruptedly involving phenomena, big and small, material and non-material that make our physical and socio- cultural environment.                                
4338. It is a process present everywhere with variations in terms of magnitude, intensity and scale.                                
4339. Change can be a gradual or slow process like the evolution of landforms and organisms                                
4340. it can be as sudden and swift as volcanic eruptions, tsunamis, earthquakes and lightening, etc.                                
4341. Similarly, it may remain confined to a smaller area occurring within a few seconds like hailstorms, tornadoes and dust storms                                
4342. It can also have global dimensions such as global warming and depletion of the ozone layer.                                
4343. Besides these, changes have different meanings for different people.                                
4344. It depends upon the perspective one takes while trying to understand them.                                
4345. From the perspective of nature, changes are value-neutral (these are neither good nor bad).                                
4346. But from the human perspective, these are value-loaded.                                
4347. While there are others like earthquakes, floods and wars that are considered bad and undesirable.                                
4348. In this chapter, we will read about some of these changes, which are considered bad and have haunted humankind for a long time.                                
4349. Disasters in general and natural disasters in particular, are some such changes that are always disliked and feared by humankind.                                
4350. For a long time, geographical literature viewed disasters as a consequence of natural forces; and human beings were treated as innocent and helpless victims in front of the mighty forces of nature.                                
4351. Disasters are also caused by some human activities.                                
4352. There are some activities carried by human beings that are directly responsible for disasters.                                
4353. Bhopal Gas tragedy, Chernobyl nuclear disaster, wars, release of CFCs (Chlorofluorocarbons) and increase of green house gases, environmental pollutions like noise, air, water and soil are some of the disasters which are caused directly by human actions.                                
4354. There are some other activities of human beings that accelerate or intensify disasters indirectly.                                
4355. Landslides and floods due to deforestation, unscientific land use and construction activities in fragile areas are some of the disasters that are the results of indirect human actions.                                
4356. Can you identify some other human activities going on in and around your neighbourhood and schools that can lead to disasters in the near future?                                
4357. Can you suggest some measures to prevent it?                                
4358. It is a commonexperience that human-made disasters have increased both in their numbers and magnitudes over the years and concerted efforts are on at various levels to prevent and minimise their occurrences.                                
4359. Though the success has been only nominal so far, it is possible to prevent some of these disasters created by human actions.                                
4360. As opposed to this, very little is possible to prevent natural disasters; therefore, the best way out is to emphasise on natural disaster mitigation and management.                                
4361. Establishment of National Institute of Disaster Management, India, Earth Summit at Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, 1993                                
4362. the World Conference on Disaster Management in May 1994 at Yokohama, Japan, etc. are some of the concrete steps towards this direction initiated at different levels.                                
4363. Most often it is observed that scholars use disasters and natural hazards as interchangeable.                                
4364. Both are related phenomena, yet quite distinct from each other.                                 
4365. Hence, it is necessary to distinguish between the two.                                
4366. As compared to natural hazards, natural disasters are relatively sudden and cause large scale, widespread death, loss of property and disturbance to social systems and life over which people have a little or no control.                                
4367. Generally, disasters are generalised experiences of people the world over, and no two disasters are similar and comparable to each other.                                
4368. Every disaster is unique in terms of the local socio-environmental factors that control it, the social response it generates, and the way each social group negotiates with it.                                
4369. The opinion mentioned above is indicative of three important things.                                
4370. Firstly, the magnitude, intensity, frequency and damages caused by natural disasters have increased over the years.                                
4371. Secondly, there is a growing concern among people the world over to deal with the menace created by these so that the loss of human life and property can be minimised.                                
4372. And finally, significant changes have taken place in the pattern of natural disasters over the years.                                
4373. There has also been a change in the perception of natural disasters and hazards.                                
4374. Previously, hazards and disasters were seen as two closely associated and interrelated phenomena, i.e. areas prone to natural hazards, were more vulnerable to disasters.                                
4375. Hence, people avoided tampering with the delicate balance that existed in a given ecosystem.                                
4376. People avoided intensification of their activities in such areas and that is how disasters were less damaging. Technological power has given large capacity to human intervention in nature.                                
4377. Consequently, now, human beings tend to intensify their activities into disaster prone areas increasing their vulnerability to disasters.                                
4378. These observations can also be corroborated by the data given in showing the magnitude of deaths caused by twelve serious natural disasters in the past sixty years in different countries of the world.                                
4379. It is evident from the table that natural disasters have caused widespread loss of life and property.                                
4380. Concerted efforts are on at various levels to take appropriate measures to deal with the situation.                                
4381. It is also being felt that the damages caused by natural disasters have global repercussions that are beyond the means and capabilities of individual nation-states to cope up with.                                
4382. Hence, this issue was raised at the U.N. General Assembly in 1989                                
4383. It was finally formalised at the World Conference on Disaster Management in May 1994 at Yokohama, Japan.                                
4384. This was subsequently called the Yokohama Strategy and Plan of Action for a Safer World.                                
4385. Human beings the world over have experienced disasters and have faced and lived with them.                                
4386. Now people are becoming aware and various steps have been initiated at different levels for mitigating the effects of disasters.                                
4387. India is one of those countries which has experienced most of the natural disasters mentioned in Table                                
4388. Every year it loses thousands of lives and property worth millions of rupees due to these natural calamities.                                
4389. In the following section, some of the highly devastating natural disasters have been discussed, particularly in the context of India.                                
4390. It was discussed in one of the previous chapters that India is vast and diverse in terms of its physical and socio-cultural attributes                                
4391. It is largely due to its vast geographical area, environmental diversities and cultural pluralities that scholars often described it using two meaningful adjectives like the ‘Indian-subcontinent’ and the ‘land of unity in diversity’.                                
4392. These observations can also be illustrated by focussing on some of the major natural disasters in India.                                
4393. These earthquakes result from a series of earth movements brought about by a sudden release of energy during the tectonic activities in the earth’s crust.                                
4394. As compared to these, the earthquakes associated with volcanic eruption, rock fall, landslides, subsidence, particularly in the mining areas, impounding of dams and reservoirs, etc.                                
4395. It was mentioned in Chapter 2 of the book that the Indian plate is moving at a speed of one centimetre per year towards the north and northeastern direction                                
4396. this movement of plates is being constantly obstructed by the Eurasian plate from the north.                                
4397. As a result of this, both the plates are said to be locked with each other resulting in accumulation of energy at different points of time.                                
4398. Excessive accumulation of energy results in building up of stress, which ultimately leads to the breaking up of the lock and the sudden release of energy causes earthquakes along the Himalayan arch.                                
4399. Some of the most vulnerable union territories/states are Jammu and Kashmir, Ladakh, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Sikkim, and the Darjeeling subdivision of West Bengal, and all the seven states of the northeast.                                
4400. earthquakes are the North-east states, areas to the north of Darbhanga and Araria along the Indo-Nepal border in Bihar, Uttarakhand, Western Himachal Pradesh (around Dharamshala) and Kashmir Valley in the Himalayan region and the Kuchchh (Gujarat).                                
4401. These are included in the Very High Damage Risk Zone.                                
4402. Similarly, the remaining parts of Jammu and Kashmir, Ladakh, Himachal Pradesh, Northern parts of Punjab, Eastern parts of Haryana, Delhi, Western Uttar Pradesh, and Northern Bihar fall under the High Damage Risk Zone.                                
4403. Remaining parts of the country fall under moderate to very Low Damage Risk Zone.                                
4404. Most of the areas that can be considered safe are from the stable landmass covered under the Deccan plateau.                                
4405. Apart from these, earthquakes also have some serious and far-reaching environmental consequences.                                
4406. Surface seismic waves produce fissures on the upper layers of the earth’s crust through which water and other volatile materials gush out, inundating the neighbouring areas.                                
4407. Sometimes, rivers also change their course causing floods and other calamities in the affected areas.                                
4408. Earthquakes and volcanic eruptions that cause the sea-floor to move abruptly resulting in sudden displacement of ocean water in the form of high vertical waves                                
4409. Normally, the seismic waves cause only one instantaneous vertical wave; but, after the initial disturbance, a series of afterwaves are created in the water that oscillate between high crest and low trough in order to restore the water level.                                
4410. The speed of wave in the ocean depends upon the depth of water.                                
4411. It is more in the shallow water than in the ocean deep.                                
4412. As a result of this, the impact of tsunami is less over the ocean and more near the coast where they cause large-scale devastations.                                
4413. Therefore, a ship at sea is not much affected by tsunami                                
4414. it is difficult to detect a tsunami in the deeper parts of sea.                                
4415. It is so because over deep water the tsunami has very long wave-length and limited wave-height.                                
4416. Thus, a tsunami wave raises the ship only a metre or two and each rise and fall takes several minutes.                                
4417. As opposed to this, when a tsunami enters shallow water, its wave-length gets reduced and the period remains unchanged, which increases the wave- height.                                
4418. Sometimes, this height can be up to 15m or more, which causes large-scale destructions along the shores.                                
4419. Thus, these are also called Shallow Water Waves.                                
4420. Tsunamis are frequently observed along the Pacific ring of fire, particularly along the coast of Alaska, Japan, Philippines, and other islands of South- east Asia, Indonesia, Malaysia, Myanmar, Sri Lanka, and India etc.                                
4421. After reaching the coast, the tsunami waves release enormous energy stored in them and water flows turbulently onto the land destroying port-cities and towns, structures, buildings and other settlements.                                
4422. Since the coastal areas are densely populated the world over, and these are also centres of intense human activity                                
4423. Unlike other natural hazards, the mitigation of hazards created by tsunami is difficult, mainly because of the fact that losses are on a much larger scale.                                
4424. It is beyond the capacity of individual state or government to mitigate the damage.                                
4425. Tropical cyclones are intense low-pressure areas confined to the area lying between 30° N and 30° S latitudes, in the atmosphere around which high velocity winds blow.                                
4426. Horizontally, it extends up to 500-1,000 km and vertically from surface to 12-14 km.                                
4427. A tropical cyclone or hurricane is like a heat engine that is energised by the release of latent heat on account of the condensation of moisture that the wind gathers after moving over the oceans and seas.                                
4428. There are differences of opinion among scientists about the exact mechanism of a tropical cyclone.                                
4429. However, some initial conditions for the emergence of a tropical cyclone are  important.                                
4430. Owing to its Peninsular shape surrounded by the Bay of Bengal in the east and the A rabian Sea in the west                                
4431. the tropical cyclones in India also originate in these two important locations.                                
4432. Though most of the cyclones originate between 10°-15° north latitudes during the monsoon season                                
4433. Yet in case of the Bay of Bengal, cyclones mostly develop during the months of October and November.                                
4434. Here, they originate between 16°-2° N latitudes and to the west of 92° E. By July the place of origin of these storms shifts to around 18° N latitude and west of 90°E near the Sunderban Delta.                                
4435. It was mentioned that the energy to the tropical cyclone comes from the latent heat released by the warm moist air.                                
4436. Hence, with the increase in distance from the sea, the force of the cyclone decreases.                                
4437. In India, the force of the cyclone decreases with increase in distance from the Bay of Bengal and the Arabian Sea.                                
4438. So, the coastal areas are often struck by severe cyclonic storms with an average velocity of 180 km/h.                                
4439. You read in newspapers and watch images of floods on televisions occurring in some regions during rainy seasons.                                
4440. Inundation of land and human settlements by the rise of water in the channels and its spill-over presents the condition of flooding.                                
4441. Unlike other natural disasters, the causes of floods are well- established.                                
4442. Floods are relatively slow in occurrences and often, occur in well-identified regions and within expected time in a year.                                
4443. Floods occur commonly when water in the form of surface run-off exceeds the carrying capacity of the river channels and streams and flows into the neighbouring low-lying flood plains.                                
4444. At times, this even goes beyond the capacity of lakes and other inland water bodies in which they flow.                                
4445. Various states of India face heavy loss of lives and property due to recurrent floods.                                
4446. Rashtriya Barh Ayog (National Flood Commission) identified 40 million hectares of land as flood-prone in India.                                
4447. The Figure shows the flood-affected areas in India                                
4448. Assam, West Bengal and Bihar are among the high flood-prone states of India.                                
4449. Apart from these, most of the rivers in the northern states like Punjab and Uttar Pradesh, are also vulnerable to occasional floods.                                
4450. It has been noticed that states like Rajasthan, Gujarat, Haryana and Punjab are also getting inundated in recent decades due to flash floods.                                
4451. This is partly because of the pattern of the monsoon and partly because of blocking of most of the streams and river channels by human activities.                                
4452. Sometimes, Tamil Nadu experiences flooding during November - January due to the retreating monsoon.                                
4453. Frequent inundation of agricultural land and human settlement, particularly in Assam, West Bengal, Bihar and Eastern Uttar Pradesh (flooding rivers), coastal areas of Odisha, Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu and Gujarat (cyclone) and Punjab, Rajasthan, Northern Gujarat and Haryana (flash floods) have serious consequences on the national economy and society.                                
4454. Floods do not only destroy valuable crops every year but these also damage physical infrastructure such as roads, rails, bridges and human settlements.                                
4455. Spread of diseases like cholera, gastro-enteritis, hepatitis and other water-borne diseases spread in the flood-affected areas                                
4456. Floods also make a few positive contributions.                                
4457. Every year, floods deposit fertile silt over agricultural fields which is good for the crops.                                
4458. Majuli (Assam), the largest riverine island in the world, is the best example of good paddy crops after the annual floods in Brahmaputra.                                
4459. But these are insignificant benefits in comparison to the grave losses.                                
4460. The Government of India as well as the state governments are well aware of the menace created by floods every year.                                
4461. How do these governments generally respond to the floods?                                
4462. Construction of flood protection embankments in the flood-prone areas, construction of dams, afforestation and discouraging major construction activities in the upper reaches of most of the flood-creating rivers, etc. are some steps that need to be taken up on urgent basis.                                
4463. Removal of human encroachment from the river channels and depopulating the flood plains can be the other steps.                                
4464. This is particularly true in western and northern parts of the country which experience flash-floods.                                
4465. Cyclone centres may provide relief in coastal areas which are hit by a storm surge.                                
4466. The term ‘drought’ is applied to an extended period when there is a shortage of water availability due to inadequate precipitation, excessive rate of evaporation and over utilisation of water from the reservoirs and ther storages, including the ground water.                                
4467. It is a situation when there is a prolonged period of inadequate rainfall marked with mal-distribution of the same over time and space.                                
4468. It is also known as soil moisture drought,                                
4469. characterised by low soil moisture that is necessary to support the crops, thereby resulting in crop failures.                                
4470. Moreover, if an area has more than 30 per cent of its gross cropped area under irrigation, the area is excluded from the drought-prone category.                                
4471. It results when the availability of water in different storages and reservoirs like aquifers, lakes, reservoirs, etc. falls below what the precipitation can replenish.                                
4472. When the productivity of a natural ecosystem fails due to shortage of water and as a consequence of ecological distress, damages are induced in the ecosystem.                                
4473. Indian agriculture has been heavily dependent on the monsoon rainfall                                
4474. Droughts and floods are the two accompanying features of Indian climate.                                
4475. According to some estimates, nearly 19 per cent of the total geographical area of the country and 12 per cent of its total population suffer due to drought every year.                                
4476. About 30 per cent of the country’s total area is identified as drought prone affecting around 50 million people.                                
4477. It is a common experience that while some parts of the country reel under floods, there are regions that face severe drought during the same period.                                
4478. This is mainly because of the large-scale variations and unpredictability in the behaviour of the monsoon in India.                                
4479. Droughts are widespread and common phenomena in most parts of the country, but these are most recurrent and severe in some and not so in others                                
4480. It is evident from the Figure that most parts of Rajasthan, particularly areas to the west of the Aravali hills, i.e. Marusthali and Kachchh regions of Gujarat fall in this category.                                
4481. Included here are also the districts like Jaisalmer and Barmer from the Indian desert that receive less that 90 mm average annual rainfall.                                
4482. Parts of eastern Rajasthan, most parts of Madhya Pradesh, eastern parts of Maharashtra, interior parts of Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka Plateau, northern parts of interior Tamil Nadu and southern parts of Jharkhand and interior Odisha are included in this category.                                
4483. Northern parts of Rajasthan, Haryana, southern districts of Uttar Pradesh, the remaining parts of Gujarat, Maharashtra except Konkan, Jharkhand and Coimbatore plateau of Tamil Nadu and interior Karnataka are included in this category.                                
4484. The remaining parts of India can be considered either free or less prone to the drought.                                
4485. Droughts have cascading effects on various other aspects of environment and society.                                
4486. Have you ever read about the blocking of roads to Srinagar or disruption of rail services by stones falling on the Konkan Railway track?                                
4487. It happens due to landslide, which is the rapid sliding of large mass of bedrocks.                                
4488. Disasters due to landslides, are in general, far less dramatic than due to earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, tsunamis and cyclones but their impact on the natural environment and national economy is in no way less severe.                                
4489. Unlike other disasters that are sudden, unpredictable and are largely controlled by macro or regional factors, landslides are largely controlled by highly localised factors.                                
4490. Hence, gathering information and monitoring the possibilities of landslide is not only difficult but also immensely cost-intensive.                                
4491. It is always difficult to define in a precise statement and generalise the occurrence and behaviour of a landslide.                                
4492. However, on the basis of past experiences, frequency and certain causal relationships with the controlling factors like geology, geomorphic agents, slope, land-use, vegetation cover and human activities, India has been divided into a number of zones.                                
4493. You may be familiar with maps that you have seen in most of your books of social sciences representing the earth or any of its parts.
4494. You may also know that the shape of the earth is geoid and a globe can best represent it.
4495. A map, on the other hand, is a simplified depiction of whole or part of the earth on a piece of paper.
4496. In other words, it is a two-dimensional form of the three-dimensional earth.
4497. Hence, a map can be drawn using a system of map projections.
4498. As it is impossible to represent all features of the earth’s surface in their true size and form, a map is drawn at a reduced scale.
4499. Imagine your school campus.
4500. If a plan/map of your school is to be drawn in its actual size, it will be as large as the campus itself.
4501. Hence, maps are drawn at a scale and projection so that each point on the paper corresponds to the actual ground position.
4502. Besides, the representation of different features is also simplified using symbols, colours and shades.
4503. A map is, therefore, defined as selective, symbolised and generalised representation of whole or a part of the earth's surface on a plane surface at a reduced scale.
4504. It may also be understood that a simple network of lines and polygons without a scale shall not be called a map.
4505. It is only referred to as “the sketch”
4506. In the present chapter, we will study the essential requirements of maps, their types and the uses
4507. In view of the variety of maps, we may find it difficult to summarise what they all have in common.
4508. Cartography, being an art and science of mapmaking, does include a series of processes that are common to all the maps.
4509. These processes that may also be referred to as essentials of maps are :
4510. Map Construction and Production
4511. Scale: We know that all maps are reductions.
4512. The first decision that a map-maker has to take is about the scale of the map.
4513. The choice of scale is of utmost importance.
4514. The scale of a map sets limits of information contents and the degree of reality with which it can be delineated on the map.
4515. provides a comparison between maps having different scales and the improvements made thereupon with the change in scale.
4516. Projection: We also know that maps are a simplified representation of the three-dimensional surface of the earth on a plane sheet of paper.
4517. The transformation of all-side-curved-geoidal surface into a plane surface is another important aspect of the cartographic process.
4518. We should know that such a radical transformation introduces some unavoidable changes in directions, distances, areas and shapes from the way they appear on a geoid.
4519. A system of transformation of the spherical surface to the plane surface is called a map projection.
4520. Hence, the choice, utilisation and construction of projections is of prime importance in map-making.
4521. Generalisation: Every map is drawn with a definite objective.
4522. For example, a general purpose map is drawn to show information of a general nature such as relief, drainage, vegetation, settlements, means of transportation, etc.
4523. Similarly, a special purpose map exhibits information pertaining to one or more selected themes like population density, soil types or location of industries.
4524. It is, therefore, necessary to carefully plan the map contents while the purpose of the map must be kept in the forefront.
4525. As maps are drawn at a reduced scale to serve a definite purpose, the third task of a cartographer is to generalise the map contents.
4526. In doing so, a cartographer must select the information relevant to the selected theme and simplify it as per the needs.
4527. Map Design: The fourth important task of a cartographer is the map design.
4528. It involves the planning of graphic characteristics of maps including the selection of appropriate symbols, their size and form, style of lettering, specifying the width of lines, selection of colours and shades, arrangement of various elements of map design within a map and design for map legend.
4529. The map design is, therefore, a complex aspect of mapmaking and requires thorough understanding of the principles that govern the effectiveness of graphic communication.
4530. Map Construction and Production: The drawing of maps and their reproduction is the fifth major task in the cartographic process.
4531. In earlier times, much of the map construction and reproduction work used to be carried out manually.
4532. Maps were drawn with pen and ink and printed mechanically.
4533. However, the map construction and reproduction has been revolutionalised with the addition of computer assisted mapping and photo-printing techniques in the recent past.
4534. HISTORY OF MAP MAKING
4535. The history of map making is as old as the history of mankind itself.
4536. The oldest map was found in Mesopotamia drawn on a clay tablet that belongs to 2,500 B.C.
4537. Ptolemy’s Map of the World.
4538. Greek and the Arab geographers laid the foundation of modern cartography.
4539. The measurement of the circumference of the Earth and the use of the system of geographical coordinates in map-making are some of the significant contributions of the Greeks and the Arabs.
4540. The art and science of map making was revitalised in early modern period, with extensive efforts made to minimise the effects of the transformation of the geoid onto a plane surface.
4541. The maps were drawn on different projections to obtain true directions, correct distances and to measure area accurately.
4542. The aerial photography supplemented the ground method of survey and the uses of aerial photographs stimulated map-making in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries.
4543. The foundation of map-making in India was laid during the Vedic period when the expressions of astronomical truths and cosmological revelations were made.
4544. The expressions were crystallised into ‘sidhantas' or laws in classical treaties of Arya Bhatta, Varahamihira and Bhaskara, and others.
4545. Ancient Indian scholars divided the known world into seven ‘dwipas’.
4546. Mahabharata conceived a round world surrounded by water.
4547. Todarmal pioneered land surveying and map-making as an integral part of the revenue collection procedure.
4548. Besides, Sher Shah Suri’s revenue maps further enriched the mapping techniques during the medieval period.
4549. The intensive topographical surveys for the preparation of up–to–date maps of the entire country, were taken up with the setting up of the Survey of India in 1767, which culminated with the map of Hindustan in 1785.
4550. Today, the Survey of India produces maps at different scales for the entire country.
4551. Types of Maps Based on Scale: On the basis of scale, maps may be classified into large-scale and small-scale.
4552. Large scale maps are drawn to show small areas at a relatively large-scale.
4553. For example, the topographical maps drawn at a scale of 1: 250,000, 1:50,000 or 1:25,000 and the village maps, the zonal plans of the cities and house plans prepared on a scale of 1:4,000, 1:2,000 and 1:500 are large scale maps.
4554. On the other hand, small-scale maps are drawn to show large areas.
4555. For example, atlas maps, wall maps, etc.
4556. Large-scale Maps: Large-scale maps are further divided into the following types :
4557. Cadastral Maps : The term ‘cadastral’ is derived from the French word ‘cadastre’ meaning ‘register of territorial property’.
4558. These maps are drawn to show the ownership of landed property by demarcating field boundaries of agricultural land and the plan of individual houses in urban areas.
4559. The cadastral maps are prepared by the government gencies to realise revenue and taxes, along with keeping a record of ownership.
4560. These maps are drawn on a very large scale, such as the cadastral maps of villages at 1 : 4,000 scale and the city plans at a scale of 1 : 2,000 and larger.
4561. Topographical Maps : These maps are also prepared on a fairly large scale.
4562. The topographical maps are based on precise surveys and are prepared in the form of series of maps made by the national mapping agencies of almost all countries of the world.
4563. For example, the Survey of India undertakes the topographical mapping of the entire country at 1 : 250,000, 1 : 50,000 and 1 : 25,000 scale.
4564. These maps follow uniform colours and symbols to show topographic details such as relief, drainage, agricultural land, forest, settlements, means of communication, location of schools, post offices and other services and facilities.
4565. Small-scale Maps: Small-scale maps are further divided into the following types :
4566. Wall Maps : These maps are generally drawn on large size paper or on plastic base for use in classrooms or lecture halls.
4567. The scale of wall maps is generally smaller than the scale of topographical maps but larger than atlas maps.
4568. Atlas Maps : Atlas maps are very small-scale maps.
4569. These maps represent fairly large areas and present highly generalised picture of the physical or cultural features.
4570. Even so, an atlas map serves as a graphic encyclopaedia of the geographical information about the world, continents, countries or regions.
4571. When consulted properly, these maps provide a wealth of generalised information regarding location, relief, drainage, climate, vegetation, distribution of cities and towns, population, location of industries, transport-network system, tourism and heritage sites, etc.
4572. Types of Maps Based on Function: The maps may also be classified on the basis of their functions.
4573. For example, a political map serves the function of providing administrative divisions of a continent or a country and a soil map shows the distribution of different types of soils.
4574. Broadly, maps based on their functions may be classified into physical maps and cultural maps.
4575. Physical Maps: Physical maps show natural features such as relief, geology, soils, drainage, elements of weather, climate and vegetation, etc.
4576. Relief Maps: Relief maps show general topography of an area like mountains and valleys, plains, plateaus and drainage.
4577. shows the relief and slope map of Nagpur district.
4578. Geological Maps: These maps are drawn to show geological structures, rock types, etc.
4579. shows the distribution of rocks and minerals in Nagpur district.
4580. Climatic Maps : These maps depict climatic regions of an area.
4581. Besides, maps are also drawn to show the distribution of temperature, rainfall, cloudiness, relative humidity, direction and velocity of winds and other elements of weather.
4582. Soil Maps : Maps are also drawn to show the distribution of different types of soil(s) and their properties.
4583. Cultural Maps: Cultural maps show man-made features.
4584. These include a variety of maps showing population distribution and growth, sex and age, social and religious composition, literacy, levels of educational attainment, occupational structure, location of settlements, facilities and services, transportation lines and production, distribution and flow of different commodities.
4585. Political Maps : These maps show the administrative divisions of an area such as country, state or district.
4586. These maps facilitate the administrative machinery in planning and management of the concerned administrative unit.
4587. Population Maps: The population maps are drawn to show the distribution, density and growth of population, age and sex composition, distribution of religious, linguistic and social groups, occupational structure of the population, etc.
4588. Population maps serve the most significant role in the planning and development of an area.
4589. Economic Maps: Economic maps depict production and distribution of different types of crops and minerals, location of industries and markets, routes for trade and flow of commodities.
4590. Show the land use and cropping patterns and the location of industries in Nagpur district respectively.
4591. Transportation Maps: These maps show roads, railway lines and the location of railway stations and airports
4592. Geographers, planners and other resource scientists use maps.
4593. In doing so, they make various types of measurements to determine distances, directions and area.
4594. Measurement of Distance: The linear features shown on the maps fall into two broad categories, i.e. straight lines and erratic or zigzag lines.
4595. The measurement of straight line features like roads, railway lines and canals is simple.
4596. It can be taken directly with a pair of dividers or a scale placed on the map surface.
4597. However, distances are required, more often, along erratic paths, i.e. the coastlines, rivers and streams.
4598. The distances along all such features can be measured by placing a thread at the starting point and carrying it along the line up to the end point The thread is then stretched and measured to determine the distance.
4599. It can also be measured by using a simple instrument called Rotameter.
4600. The wheel of the 'rotameter' is moved along the route to measure the distance.
4601. Measurement of Direction: Direction is defined as an imaginary straight line on the map showing the angular position to a common base direction.
4602. The line pointing to the north is zero direction or the base direction line.
4603. A map always shows the north direction.
4604. All other directions are determined in to this relation.
4605. In between the cardinal points, one may have several intermediate directions.
4606. These are also called the cardinal points.
4607. Measurement of Area: The measurement of area of features like that of administrative and geographic units is also carried out over the surface of the map by map-users.
4608. There are different methods in which areas can be determined.
4609. One of the simplest but not very accurate method to determine the area is by means of regular pattern of squares.
4610. In this method, the area to be measured is covered by squares by placing a sheet of graph paper beneath the map on an illuminated tracing table or by tracing the area onto the square sheet.
4611. The total number of 'whole squares' are summed up, together with 'partial squares'.
4612. The area is then determined by a simple equation :
4613. The area can also be calculated by using a fixed area polar planimeter.
4614. The area can also be calculated by using a fixed area polar planimeter.
4615. You have read in Chapter 1 that the scale is an essential element of all types of maps.
4616. It is so important that if a network of lines and polygons does not carry a scale, we call it a “sketch”.
4617. Why is the scale so important ?
4618. What does it mean ?
4619. What are the different methods of showing the scale on a map?
4620. How useful is the scale in measuring the distances and the area?
4621. These are some of the questions which will be taken up in the present chapter.
4622. What is Scale ?
4623. You must have seen maps with a scale bar indicating equal divisions, each marked with readings in kilometres or miles.
4624. These divisions are used to find out the ground distance on the map.
4625. In other words, a map scale provides the relationship between the map and the whole or a part of the earth’s surface shown on it.
4626. We can also express this relationship as a ratio of distances between two points on the map and the corresponding distance between the same two points on the ground.
4627. There are at least three ways in which this relationship can be expressed.
4628. Each of these methods of scale has advantages and limitations.
4629. But before taking up these issues, let us understand that the scale is normally expressed in one or the other system of measurement.
4630. You must have read and/or used kilometre, metre, centimetre etc. to measure the linear distances between two points on the ground.
4631. You might have also heard of miles, furlongs, yards, feet, etc.
4632. These are two different systems of measurement of the distances used in different countries of the world.
4633. Whereas the former system is referred to as the Metric System of Measurement and presently used in India and many other countries of the world, the latter system is known as the English System of Measurement and is prevalent in both the United States and the United Kingdom.
4634. India also used this system for measuring/showing linear distances before 1957.
4635. METHODS OF SCALE
4636. As mentioned above, the scale of the map may be expressed using one or a combination of more than one methods of scale.
4637. Let us see how these methods are used and what are their advantages and limitations
4638. Statement of Scale: The scale of a map may be indicated in the form of a written statement.
4639. For example, if on a map a written statement appears stating 1 cm represents 10 km, it means that on that map a distance of 1 cm is representing 10 km of the corresponding ground distance.
4640. It may also be expressed in any other system of measurement, i.e. 1 inch represents 10 miles.
4641. It is the simplest of the three methods.
4642. However, it may be noted that the people who are familiar with one system may not understand the statement of scale given in another system of measurement.
4643. Another limitation of this method is that if the map is reduced or enlarged, the scale will become redundant and a new scale is to be worked out.
4644. Graphical or Bar Scale: The second type of scale shows map distances and the corresponding ground distances using a line bar with primary and secondary divisions marked on it.
4645. This is referred to as the graphical scale or bar scale.
4646. It may be noted that the scale readings as shown on the bar scale in reads only in kilometres and metres.
4647. In yet another bar scale the readings may be shown in miles and furlongs.
4648. Hence, like the statement of scale method, this method also finds restricted use for only those who can understand it.
4649. However, unlike the statement of the scale method, the graphical scale stands valid even when the map is reduced or enlarged.
4650. This is the unique advantage of the graphical method of the map scale.
4651. Representative Fraction: The third type of scale is R.F.
4652. It shows the relationship between the map distance and the corresponding ground distance in units of length.
4653. The use of units to express the scale makes it the most versatile method.
4654. R. F. is generally shown in fraction because it shows how much the real world is reduced to fit on the map.
4655. For example, a fraction of 1 :24,000 shows that one unit of length on the map represents 24,000 of the same units on the ground i.e. one mm, one cm or one inch on the map representing 24,000 mm, 24,000 cm and 24,000 inches, respectively of the ground.
4656. It may, however, be noted that while converting the fraction of units into Metric or English systems, units in centimetre or inch are normally used by convention.
4657. This quality of expressing scale in units in R. F. makes it a universally acceptable and usable method.
4658. Let us take R. F. of 1 : 36,000 to elaborate the universal nature of R. F.
4659. If the given scale is 1: 36,000, a person acquainted with the Metric System will read the given units by converting them into cm, i.e. the distance of 1 unit on the map as 1 cm and the distance of 36,000 units on the ground distance as 36,000 cm.
4660. These values may subsequently be converted into a statement of scale, i.e. 1 cm represents 360 metres.
4661. Yet another user of the map familiar with the English system of measurement will understand the map scale by converting it into a statement of scale convenient to him/her and read the map scale as 1 inch represents 1,000 yards.
4662. The said statement of scale will be obtained by dividing 36,000 units in the denominator by 36.
4663. CONVERSION OF SCALE
4664. If you have carefully read the advantages and limitations of the different methods of scale, then it will not be difficult for you to convert the Statement of Scale into Representative Fraction and vice-versa.
4665. Statement of Scale into R. F.
4666. Problem Convert the given Statement of Scale of 1 inch represents 4 miles into R. F.
4667. Solution The given Statement of Scale may be converted into R. F. using the following steps.
4668. 1 inch represents 4 miles
4669. 1 inch represents 360 inches
4670. or 1 inch represents 440 inches
4671. NOTE : We can now replace the character “inches” into “units” and read it as : 1 unit represents 253,440 Units
4672. Answer R. F. 1 : 253, 440
4673. R. F. into Statement of Scale
4674. Problem Convert R. F. 1 : 253, 440 into Statement of Scale
4675. Solution The given R. F. of 1 : 253, 440 may be converted into Statement of Scale using the following steps :
4676. 1 : 253, 440 means that
4677. 1 unit on the map represents 253, 440 units on the ground.
4678. or 1 cm represents 253, 440/100,000 (1 km = 100,000cm)
4679. After rounding of up to 2 decimals, the answer will be :
4680. Answer 1 cm represents 2.53 km
4681. Construction of the Graphical/Bar Scale
4682. Problem 1 Construct a graphical scale for a map drawn at a scale of 1 : 50,000 and read the distances in kilometre and metre.
4683. NOTE: By convention, a length of nearly 15 cm is taken to draw a graphical scale.
4684. Calculations To get the length of line for the graphical scale, these steps may be followed: 1 : 50,000 means that 1 unit of the map represents 50,000 units on the ground
4685. 1 cm represents 50,000 cm
4686. or 15 cm represents 50,000 × 15/100,000 km
4687. or 15 cm represents 7.5 km Since the value of 7.5 (km) is not a round number, we can choose 5 or 10 (km) as the round number.
4688. In the present case, we choose 5 as the round number.
4689. To determine the length of the line to show 5 km, the following calculations are to be carried out:
4690. 7.5 km is represented by a line of 15 cm
4691. 5 km will be represented by a line of 15 × 5/7.5
4692. or 5 km will be represented by a line of 10 cm
4693. The graphical scale may be constructed by following these steps:
4694. Draw a straight line of 10 cm and divide it into 5 equal parts 
4695. and assign a value of 1 km each for 4 right side divisions from the 0 mark.
4696. Also divide the extreme left side division into 10 equal parts and mark each division by a value of 100 metres, beginning from 0.
4697. Do you think that what exists today will continue to be so, or the future is going to be different in some respects?
4698. It can be said with some certainty that the societies will witness demographic transition, geographical shift of population, technological advancement, degradation of environment and water scarcity.
4699. Water scarcity is possibly to pose the greatest challenge on account of its increased demand coupled with shrinking supplies due to over utilisation and pollution.
4700. Water is a cyclic resource with abundant supplies on the globe.
4701. Approximately, 71 per cent of the earth’s surface is covered with it but freshwater constitutes only about 3 per cent of the total water.
4702. In fact, a very small proportion of freshwater is effectively available for human use.
4703. The availability of freshwater varies over space and time.
4704. The tensions and disputes on sharing and control of this scarce resource are becoming contested issues among communities, regions, and states.
4705. The assessment, efficient use and conservation of water, therefore, become necessary to ensure development.
4706. In this chapter, we shall discuss water resources in India, its geographical distribution, sectoral utilisation, and methods of its conservation and management.
4707. Water Resources of India
4708. India accounts for about 2.45 per cent of the world’s surface area, 4 per cent of the world’s water resources and about 16 per cent of the world’s population.
4709. The total water available from precipitation in the country in a year is about 4,000 cubic km.
4710. The availability from surface water and replenishable groundwater is 1,869 cubic km.
4711. Out of this, only 60 per cent can be put to beneficial uses.
4712. Thus, the total utilisable water resource in the country is only 1,122 cubic km.
4713. Surface Water Resources
4714. There are four major sources of surface water.
4715. These are rivers, lakes, ponds and tanks.
4716. In the country, there are about 10,360 rivers and their tributaries longer than 1.6 km each.
4717. The mean annual flow in all the river basins in India is estimated to be 1,869 cubic km.
4718. However, due to topographical, hydrological and other constraints, only about 690 cubic km of the available surface water can be utilised.
4719. Water flow in a river depends on size of its catchment area or river basin and rainfall within its catchment area.
4720. Precipitation in India has very high spatial variation, and it is mainly concentrated in Monsoon season.
4721. You also have studied in the textbook that some of the rivers in the country like the Ganga, the Brahmaputra, and the Indus have huge catchment areas.
4722. Given that precipitation is relatively high in the catchment areas of the Ganga, the Brahmaputra and the Barak rivers,
4723. these rivers, although account for only about one-third of the total area in the country, have 60 per cent of the total surface water resources.
4724. Much of the annual water flow in south Indian rivers like the Godavari, the Krishna, and the Kaveri has been harnessed, but it is yet to be done in the Brahmaputra and the Ganga basins.
4725. Groundwater Resources
4726. The total replenishable groundwater resources in the country are about 432 cubic km.
4727. The level of groundwater utilisation is relatively high in the river basins lying in north-western region and parts of south India.
4728. The groundwater utilisation is very high in the states of Punjab, Haryana, Rajasthan, and Tamil Nadu.
4729. However, there are States like Chhattisgarh, Odisha, Kerala, etc., which utilise only a small proportion of their groundwater potentials.
4730. States like Gujarat, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Tripura and Maharashtra are utilising their groundwater resources at a moderate rate.
4731. If the present trend continues, the demands for water would need the supplies.
4732. And such situation, will be detrimental to development, and can cause social upheaval and disruptions.
4733. Lagoons and Backwaters
4734. India has a vast coastline and the coast is very indented in some states.
4735. Due to this, a number of lagoons and lakes have formed.
4736. The States like Kerala, Odisha and West Bengal have vast surface water resources in these lagoons and lakes.
4737. Although, water is generally brackish in these water bodies, it is used for fishing and irrigating certain varieties of paddy crops, coconut, etc.
4738. Water Demand and Utilisation
4739. India has traditionally been an agrarian economy, and about two-third of its population have been dependent on agriculture.
4740. Hence, development of irrigation to increase agricultural production has been assigned a very high priority in the Five Year Plans, and multipurpose river valleys projects, like the Bhakra-Nangal, Hirakud, Damodar Valley, Nagarjuna Sagar, Indira Gandhi Canal Project, etc., have been taken up.
4741. In fact, India’s water demand at present is dominated by irrigational needs.
4742. Agriculture accounts for most of the surface and groundwater utilisation, it accounts for 89 per cent of the surface water and 92 per cent of the groundwater utilisation.
4743. While the share of industrial sector is limited to 2 per cent of the surface water utilisation and 5 per cent of the ground-water,
4744. the share of domestic sector is higher in surface water utilisation as compared to groundwater.
4745. The share of agricultural sector in total water utilisation is much higher than other sectors.
4746. However, in future, with development, the shares of industrial and domestic sectors in the country are likely to increase.
4747. Demand of Water for Irrigation
4748. In agriculture, water is mainly used for irrigation.
4749. Irrigation is needed because of spatio-temporal variability in rainfall in the country.
4750. The large tracts of the country are deficient in rainfall and are drought prone.
4751. North-western India and Deccan plateau constitute such areas.
4752. Winter and summer seasons are more or less dry in most part of the country.
4753. Hence, it is difficult to practise agriculture without assured irrigation during dry seasons.
4754. Even in the areas of ample rainfall like West Bengal and Bihar, breaks in monsoon or its failure creates dry spells detrimental for agriculture.
4755. Water need of certain crops also makes irrigation necessary.
4756. For instance, water requirement of rice, sugarcane, jute, etc. is very high which can be met only through irrigation.
4757. Provision of irrigation makes multiple cropping possible.
4758. It has also been found that irrigated lands have higher agricultural productivity than unirrigated land.
4759. Further, the high yielding varieties of crops need regular moisture supply, which is made possible only by a developed irrigation systems.
4760. In fact, this is why that green revolution strategy of agriculture development in the country has largely been successful in Punjab, Haryana and western Uttar Pradesh.
4761. In Punjab, Haryana and western Uttar Pradesh, more than 85 per cent of their net sown area is under irrigation.
4762. Wheat and rice are grown mainly with the help of irrigation in these states.
4763. Of the total net irrigated area 76.1 per cent in Punjab and 51.3 per cent in Haryana are irrigated through wells and tubewells.
4764. This shows that these states utilise large proportion of their groundwater potential which has resulted in groundwater depletion in these states.
4765. The over-use of groundwater resources has led to decline in groundwater table in these states.
4766. In fact, over withdrawals in some states, like Rajasthan and Maharashtra, has increased fluoride concentration in groundwater, and this practice has led to increase in concentration of arsenic in parts of West Bengal and Bihar.
4767. Emerging Water Problems
4768. The per capita availability of water is dwindling day-by-day due to increase in population.
4769. The available water resources are also getting polluted with industrial, agricultural and domestic effluents, and this, in turn, is further limiting the availability of usable water resources.
4770. Deterioration of Water Quality
4771. Water quality refers to purity of water, or water without unwanted foreign substances.
4772. Water gets polluted by foreign matters, such as micro-organisms, chemicals, industrial and other wastes.
4773. Such matters deteriorate the quality of water and render it unfit for human use.
4774. When toxic substances enter lakes, streams, rivers, ocean and other water bodies, they get dissolved or lie suspended in water.
4775. This results in pollution of water, whereby quality of water deteriorates affecting aquatic systems.
4776. Sometimes, these pollutants also seep down and pollute groundwater.
4777. The Ganga and the Yamuna are the two highly polluted rivers in the country.
4778. Water Conservation and Management
4779. Since there is a declining availability of freshwater and increasing demand, the need has arisen to conserve and effectively manage this precious life giving resource for sustainable development.
4780. Given that water availability from sea/ocean, due to high cost of desalinisation, is considered negligible,
4781. India has to take quick steps and make effective policies and laws, and adopt effective measures for its conservation.
4782. Besides developing water-saving technologies and methods, attempts are also to be made to prevent the pollution.
4783. There is need to encourage watershed development, rainwater harvesting, water recycling and reuse, and conjunctive use of water for sustaining water supply in long run.
4784. Prevention of Water Pollution
4785. Available water resources are degrading rapidly.
4786. The major rivers of the country generally retain better water quality in less densely populated upper stretches in hilly areas.
4787. In plains, river water is used intensively for irrigation, drinking, domestic and industrial purposes.
4788. The drains carrying agricultural, domestic, and industrial effluents join the rivers.
4789. The concentration of pollutants in rivers, especially remains very high during the summer season when flow of water is low.
4790. The Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) in collaboration with State Pollution Control Boards has been monitoring water quality of national aquatic resources at 507 stations.
4791. The data obtained from these stations show that organic and bacterial contamination continues to be the main source of pollution in rivers.
4792. The Yamuna river is the most polluted river in the country between Delhi and Etawah.
4793. Other severely polluted rivers are: the Sabarmati at Ahmedabad, the Gomti at Lucknow, the Kali, the Adyar, the Cooum, the Vaigai at Madurai and the Musi of Hyderabad and the Ganga at Kanpur and Varanasi.
4794. Groundwater pollution has occurred due to high concentrations of heavy/toxic metals, fluoride and nitrates at different parts of the country.
4795. The legislative provisions such as the Water Act 1974,
4796. Environment Protection Act 1986 have not been implemented effectively.
4797. The result is that in 1997, 251 polluting industries were located along the rivers and lakes.
4798. The Water Cess Act, 1977, meant to reduce pollution has also made marginal impacts.
4799. There is a strong need to generate public awareness about importance of water and impacts of water pollution.
4800. The public awareness and action can be very effective in reducing the pollutants from agricultural activities, domestic and industrial discharges.
4801. Recycle and Reuse of Water
4802. Another way through which we can improve fresh water availability is by recycle and reuse.
4803. Use of water of lesser quality such as reclaimed wastewater would be an attractive option for industries for cooling and fire fighting to reduce their water cost.
4804. Similarly, in urban areas water after bathing and washing utensils can be used for gardening.
4805. Water used for washing vehicle can also be used for gardening.
4806. This would conserve better quality of water for drinking purposes.
4807. Currently, recycling of water is practised on a limited scale.
4808. However, there is enormous scope for replenishing water through recycling.
4809. Watershed Management
4810. Watershed management basically refers to efficient management and conservation of surface and groundwater resources.
4811. It involves prevention of runoff and storage and recharge of groundwater through various methods like percolation tanks, recharge wells, etc.
4812. However, in broad sense watershed management includes conservation, regeneration and judicious use of all resources – natural and human with in a watershed.
4813. Watershed management aims at bringing about balance between natural resources on the one hand and society on the other.
4814. The success of watershed development largely depends upon community participation.
4815. The Central and State Governments have initiated many watershed development and management programmes in the country.
4816. Some of these are being implemented by nongovernmental organisations also.
4817. Haryali is a watershed development project sponsored by the Central Government which aims at enabling the rural population to conserve water for drinking, irrigation, fisheries and afforestation.
4818. The Project is being executed by Gram Panchayats with people’s participation.
4819. Neeru-Meeru programme and Arvary Pani Sansad have taken up constructions of various water-harvesting structures such as percolation tanks, dug out ponds, check dams, etc., through people’s participation.
4820. Tamil Nadu has made water harvesting structures in the houses compulsory.
4821. No building can be constructed without making structures for water harvesting.
4822. Watershed development projects in some areas have been successful in rejuvenating environment and economy.
4823. However, there are only a few success stories.
4824. In majority of cases, the programme is still in its nascent stage.
4825. There is a need to generate awareness regarding benefits of watershed development and management among people in the country, and through this integrated water resource management approach water availability can be ensured on sustainable basis.
4826. Rainwater Harvesting
4827. Rainwater harvesting is a method to capture and store rainwater for various uses.
4828. It is also used to recharge groundwater aquifers.
4829. It is a low cost and eco-friendly technique for preserving every drop of water by guiding the rain water to borewell, pits and wells.
4830. Rainwater harvesting increases water availability, checks the declining groundwater table, improves the quality of groundwater through dilution of contaminants, like fluoride and nitrates, prevents soil erosion, and flooding and arrests salt water intrusion in coastal areas if used to recharge aquifers.
4831. Rainwater harvesting has been practised through various methods by different communities in the country for a long time.
4832. Traditional rainwater harvesting in rural areas is done by using surface storage bodies, like lakes, ponds, irrigation tanks, etc.
4833. In Rajasthan, rainwater harvesting structures locally known as Kund or Tanka are constructed near or in the house or village to store harvested rainwater.
4834. There is a wide scope to use rainwater harvesting technique to conserve precious water resource.
4835. It can be done by harvesting rainwater on rooftops and open spaces.
4836. Harvesting rainwater also decreases the community dependence on groundwater for domestic use.
4837. Besides bridging the demandsupply gap, it can also save energy to pump groundwater as recharge leads to rise in groundwater table.
4838. These days rainwater harvesting is being taken up on massive scale in many states in the country.
4839. Urban areas can specially benefit from rainwater harvesting as water demand has already outstripped supply in most of the cities and towns.
4840. Apart from the above mentioned factors, the issue desalination of water particularly in coastal areas and brackish water in arid and semi-arid areas, transfer of water from water surplus areas to water deficit areas through inter-linking of rivers can be important remedies for solving water problem in India.
4841. However, the most important issue from the point of view of individual users, households and communities is pricing of water.
4842. We use various items to satisfy our needs.
4843. Agricultural products like wheat, rice, etc. are to be processed into flour, husked rice before we consume these.
4844. But besides bread and rice, we also require clothes, books, fans, cars, medicines, etc. and these are manufactured in various industries.
4845. In modern times industries have become very important part of an economy.
4846. They provide employment to large labour force and contribute significantly in the total national wealth/income.
4847. Industries are classified in a number of ways.
4848. On the basis of size, capital investment and labour force employed, industries are classified as large, medium, small scale, and cottage industries.
4849. On the basis of ownership, industries are categorised as : Public sector,  private sector, and  joint and cooperative sector, Public sector enterprises are government/state controlled companies or corporations funded by governments.
4850. Industries of strategic and national importance are usually in the public sector.
4851. Industries are also classified on the basis of the use of their products such as : basic goods industries,  capital goods industries  intermediate goods industries, and consumer goods industries.
4852. Another method of classifying industries is on the basis of raw materials used by them.
4853. Accordingly, these can be : agriculture- based industries,  forest-based industries, mineral-based industries, and  industrially processed raw material- based industries.
4854. Another common classification of industries is based on the nature of the manufactured products.
4855. Eight classes of industries, thus identified are :  Metallurgical Industries,  Mechanical Engineering Industries,  Chemical and Allied Industries,  Textile Industries,  Food Processing Industries,Electricity Generation,  Electronics and  Communication Industries.
4856. Sometimes, you also read about foot loose industries. What are these?
4857. Have they any relationship with raw material location or not?
4858. Can you guess the reasons for the location of iron and steel industry in eastern and southern India?
4859. Why is there no iron and steel industry in U.P., Haryana, Punjab, Rajasthan and Gujarat?
4860. Location of industries is influenced by several factors like access to raw materials, power, market, capital, transport and labour, etc.
4861. Relative significance of these factors varies with time and place.
4862. There is strong relationship between raw material and type of industry.
4863. It is economical to locate the manufacturing industries at a place where cost of production and delivery cost of manufactured goods to consumers are the least. 
4864.  Transport costs, to a great extent, depend on the nature of raw materials and manufactured products.
4865. A brief description of factors influencing the location of industries are given below:
4866. Industries using weight-losing raw materials are located in the regions where raw materials are located.
4867. Why are the sugar mills in India located in sugarcane growing areas?
4868. Similarly, the locations of pulp industry, copper smelting and pig iron industries are located near their raw materials.
4869. In iron and steel industries, iron ore and coal both are weight losing raw materials.
4870. Therefore, an optimum location for iron and steel industries should be near raw material sources.
4871. This is why most of the iron and steel industries are located either near coalfields (Bokaro, Durgapur, etc.) or near sources of iron ore (Bhadravati, Bhilai, and Rourkela).
4872. Power provides the motive force for machines, and therefore, its supply has to be ensured before the location of any industry.
4873. However, certain industries, like aluminium and synthetic nitrogen manufacturing industries tend to be located near sources of power because they are power intensive and require huge quantum of electricity.
4874. Markets provide the outlets for manufactured products.
4875. Heavy machine, machine tools, heavy chemicals are located near the high demand areas as these are market orientated.
4876. Cotton textile industry uses a non-weight-losing raw material and is generally located in large urban centre, e.g. Mumbai, Ahmedabad, Surat, etc.
4877. Petroleum refineries are also located near the markets as the transport of crude oil is easier and several products derived from them are used as raw material in other industries.
4878. Koyali, Mathura and Barauni refineries are typical examples.
4879. Ports also play a crucial role in the location of oil refineries.
4880. Have you ever tried to find out the reasons for the concentration of industries in Mumbai, Chennai, Delhi and in and around Kolkata?
4881. It was due to the fact that they initially became the nodal point having transport links.
4882. The industries shifted to interior locations, only when railway lines were laid.
4883. All major industrial plants are located on the trunk rail routes.
4884. Can we think of an industry without labour?
4885. Industries require skilled labour.
4886. In India, labour is quite mobile and is available in large numbers due to our large population.
4887. Have you ever thought of the reasons for emerging Mumbai, Kolkata and Chennai as industrial nodes?
4888. These locations were greatly influenced by our colonial past.
4889. During the initial phase of colonisation, manufacturing activities received new impetus provided by the European traders.
4890. Places like Murshidabad, Dhaka, Bhadohi, Surat, Vadodara, Kozhikode, Coimbatore, Mysuru etc., emerged as important manufacturing centres.
4891. In the subsequent industrial phase of colonialism, these manufacturing centres experienced rapid growth due to  competition from the goods manufactured in Britain and the discriminatory policies of colonial power.
4892. In the last phase of colonialism, the British promoted few industries in selected areas.
4893. This led to larger spatial coverage by different types of industries in the country.
4894. India, being a democratic country aims at bringing about economic growth with balanced regional development.
4895. Establishment of iron and steel industry in Bhilai and Rourkela were based on decision to develop backward tribal areas of the country.
4896. At present, government of India provides lots of incentives to industries locating in backward areas.
4897. The development of the iron and steel industry opened the doors to rapid industrial development in India.
4898. Almost all sectors of the Indian industry depend heavily on the iron and steel industry for their basic infrastructure.
4899. Can we make tools to be used in agriculture without iron?
4900. The other raw materials besides iron ore and coking coal, essential for iron and steel industry are limestone, dolomite, manganese and fire clay.
4901. All these raw materials are gross (weight losing).
4902. therefore, the best location for the iron and steel plants is near the source of raw materials.
4903. In India, there is a crescent shaped region comprising parts of Chhattisgarh, Northern Odisha, Jharkhand and western West Bengal, which is extremely rich in high grade iron ore, good quality coking coal and other supplementing raw materials.
4904. The Indian iron and steel industry consists of large integrated steel plants as well as mini steel mills.
4905. It also includes secondary producers, rolling mills and ancillary industries.
4906. The Tata Iron and Steel plant lies very close to the Mumbai-Kolkata railway line and about 240 km away from Kolkata, which is the nearest port for the export of steel.
4907.  The rivers Subarnarekha and Kharkai provide water to the plant.The iron ore for the plant is obtained from Noamundi and Badam Pahar and coal is brought from Joda mines in Odisha Coking coal comes from Jharia and west Bokaro coalfields.
4908. The Indian Iron and Steel Company (IISCO) set up its first factory at Hirapur and later on another at Kulti.
4909. In 1937, the Steel corporation of Bengal was constituted in association with IISCO and set up another iron and steel producing unit at Burnpur (West Bengal).
4910. All the three plants under IISCO are located very close to Damodar valley coal fields (Raniganj, Jharia, and Ramgarh).
4911. Iron ore comes from Singhbhum in Jharkhand.
4912. Water is obtained from the Barakar River, a tributary of the Damodar.
4913. All the plants are located along the Kolkata-Asansol railway line Unfortunately, steel production from IISCO fell considerably in 1972-73 and the plants were taken over by the government.
4914. The third integrated steel plant, the Visvesvaraiya Iron and Steel Works, initially called the Mysore Iron and Steel Works, is located close to an iron ore producing area of Kemangundi in the Bababudan hills.
4915. Limestone and manganese are also locally available.
4916. But this region has no coal..
4917. At the beginning, charcoal obtained by burning wood from nearby forests was used as fuel till 1951
4918. Afterwards, electric furnaces were installed which use hydroelectricity from the Jog Falls hydel power project.
4919. The Bhadravati river supplies water to the plant.
4920. This plant produces specialised steels and alloys.
4921. After independence, during the Second Five Year Plan (1956-61), three new integrated steel plants were set up with foreign collaboration:
4922. Rourkela in Odisha, Bhilai in Chhattisgarh and Durgapur in West Bengal.
4923. These were public sector plants under Hindustan Steel Limited (HSL).
4924. In 1973, the Steel Authority of India Limited (SAIL) was created to manage these plants.
4925. The Rourkela Steel plant was set up in 1959 in the Sundargarh district of Odisha in collaboration with Germany.
4926. The plant was located on the basis of proximity to raw materials, thus, minimising the cost of transporting weight losing raw material.
4927. This plant has a unique locational advantage, as it receives coal from Jharia (Jharkhand) and iron ore from Sundargarh and Kendujhar.
4928. The Hirakud project supplies power for the electric furnaces and water is obtained from the Koel and Sankh rivers.
4929. The Bhilai Steel Plant was established with Russian collaboration in Durg district of Chhattisgarh and started production in 1959.
4930. Iron ore comes from Dalli-Rajhara mine (Fig. 8.6) and coal from Korba and Kargali coal fields.
4931. Water comes from the Tanduladam and the power from the Korba Themal Power Station.
4932. This plant also lies on the Kolkata- Mumbai railway route.
4933. The bulk of the steel produced goes to the Hindustan Shipyard at Vishakhapatnam.
4934. Durgapur Steel Plant in West Bengal was set up in collaboration with the government of the United Kingdom and started production in 1962.
4935. This plant lies in Raniganj and Jharia coal belt and gets iron ore from Noamundi (Fig. 8.7).
4936. Durgapur lies on the main Kolkata-Delhi railway route.
4937. Hydel power and water is obtained from the Damodar Valley Corporation (DVC).
4938. This steel plant was set up in 1964 at Bokaro with Russian collaboration.
4939. This plant was set up on the principle of transportation cost minimisation by creating Bokaro-Rourkela combine It receives iron ore from the Rourkela region and the wagons on return take coal to Rourkela.
4940. Other raw materials come to Bokaro from within a radius of about 350 km.
4941. Water and hydel power is supplied by the Damodar Valley Corporation.
4942. New steel plants which were set up in the Fourth Plan period are away from the main raw material sources.
4943. All three plants are located in South India.
4944. The Vizag Steel Plant, in Vishakhapatnam in Andhra Pradesh is the first port-based plant which started operating in 1992.
4945. Its port location is of advantage.
4946. The Vijaynagar Steel Plant at Hosapete in Karnataka was developed using indigenous technology.
4947. This uses local iron ore and limestone .
4948. The Salem Steel Plant in Tamil Nadu was commissioned in 1982.
4949. Apart from these major steel plants, there are more than 206 units located in different parts of the country.
4950. Most of these use scrap iron as their main raw material, and process it in electric furnaces.
4951. The cotton textile industry is one of the traditional industries of India.
4952. In the ancient and the medieval times, it used to be only a cottage industry.
4953. India was famous worldwide for the production of muslin, a very fine variety of cotton cloth, calicos, chintz and other different varieties of fine cotton cloth.
4954. The development of this industry in India was due to several factors.
4955. One, it is a tropical country and cotton is the most comfortable fabric for a hot and humid climate.
4956. Second, large quantity of cotton was grown in India.
4957. Abundant skilled labour required for this industry was available in this country.
4958. In fact, in some areas the people were producing cotton textiles for generations and transferred the skill from one generation to the other and in the process perfected their skills.
4959. Initially, the British did not encourage the development of the indigenous cotton textile industry.
4960. They exported raw cotton to their mills in Manchester and Liverpool and brought back the finished products to be sold in India.
4961. This cloth was cheaper because it was produced at mass scale in factories in U.K. as compared to the cottage based industries of India.
4962. In 1854, the first modern cotton mill was established in Mumbai.
4963. This city had several advantages as a cotton textile manufacturing centre.
4964. It was very close to the cotton producing areas of Gujarat and Maharashtra.
4965. Raw cotton used to be brought to Mumbai port to be transported to England.
4966. Therefore, cotton was available in Mumbai city itself.
4967. Moreover, Mumbai even then was the financial centre and the capital needed to start an industry was available there.
4968. As a large town, providing employment opportunities attracted labour in large numbers.
4969. Hence, cheap and abundant labour too was available locally.
4970. The machinery required for a cotton textile mill could be directly imported from England.
4971. Subsequently, two more mills, the Shahpur Mill and the Calico Mill were established in Ahmedabad.
4972. By 1947, the number of mills in India went up to 423 but the scenario changed after partition, and this industry suffered a major recession.
4973. This was due to the fact that the most of the good quality cotton growing areas had gone to West Pakistan and India was left with 409 mills and only 29 per cent of the cotton producing area.
4974. After Independence, this industry gradually recovered and eventually flourished.
4975. The cotton textile industry in India can be broadly divided into two sectors, the organised sector and the unorganised sector.
4976. The decentralised sector includes cloth produced in handlooms (including Khadi) and powerlooms.
4977. The production of the organised sector has drastically fallen from 81 per cent in the mid-twentieth century to only about 6 per cent in 2000.
4978. At present, the powerlooms on the decentralised sector produce more than the handloom sector.
4979. Cotton is a “pure” raw material which does not lose weight in the manufacturing process.
4980. so other factors, like, power to drive the looms, labour, capital or market may determine the location of the industry.
4981. At present the trend is to locate the industry at or close to markets, as it is the market that decides what kind of cloth is to be produced.
4982. Also the market for the finished products is extremely variable, therefore, it becomes important to locate the mills close to the market.
4983. Mills were also set up at Kolkata due to its port facilities.
4984. The development of hydro-electricity also favoured the location of the cotton textile mills away from the cotton producing areas.
4985. The rapid development of this industry in Tamil Nadu is the result of the abundant availability of hydel power for the mills.
4986. Lower labour costs at centres like Ujjain, Bharuch, Agra, Hathras, Coimbatore and Tirunelveli also caused industries to be located away from cotton producing areas.
4987. Thus, the cotton textile industry is locate  in almost every state in India, where one or more of the locational factors have been favourable.
4988. The importance of raw materials has given way to market or to a cheaper local labour force or it may be the availability of power.
4989. Presently, the major centres of the cotton textile industry are Ahmedabad, Bhiwandi, Solapur, Kolhapur, Nagpur, Indore and Ujjain.
4990. All these centres are the traditional centres and are located close to the cotton producing regions.
4991. Maharashtra, Gujarat and Tamil Nadu are the leading cotton producing states.
4992. West Bengal, Uttar Pradesh, Karnataka, and Punjab are the other important cotton textile producers.
4993. Tamil Nadu has the largest number of mills and most of them produce yarn rather than cloth.
4994. Coimbatore has emerged as the most important centre with nearly half the mills located there.
4995. Chennai, Madurai, Tirunelveli, Tuticorin, Thanjavur, Ramanathapuram and Salem are the other important centres.
4996. In Karnataka, the cotton textile industry has developed in the cotton producing areas in the north-eastern part of the state.
4997. Davangere, Hubballi, Ballari, Mysuru and Bengaluru are important centres.
4998. In Uttar Pradesh, Kanpur is the largest centre.
4999. Some of the other important centres are Modinagar, Hathras, Saharanpur, Agra and Lucknow.
5000. In West Bengal, the cotton mills are located in the Hugli region.
5001. Howrah, Serampur, Kolkata and Shyamnagar are the important centres.
5002. Production of cotton cloth increased almost five times since independence.
5003. Cotton textile has been facing tough competition from synthetic cloth.
5004. What are the other problems of cotton textile industry in India?
5005. The sugar industry is the second most important agro-based industry in the country.
5006. India is the largest producer of both sugarcane and canesugar and contributes about 8 per cent of thetotal sugar production in the world.
5007. Besides, khandasari and gur or jaggery are also preparedfrom sugarcane.
5008. This industry providesemployment for more than 4 lakh personsdirectly and a large number of farmers indirectly.
5009. Sugar industry is a seasonal industry becauseof the seasonality of raw materials.
5010. Development of the industry on modern lines dates back to 1903, when a sugar mill was started in Bihar.
5011. Subsequently, sugar mills were started in other parts of Bihar and Uttar Pradesh.
5012. In 1950-51, 139 factories were in operation. The number of sugar factories rose to 662 in 2010-11.
5013. Sugarcane is a weight-losing crop.
5014. The ratio of sugar to sugarcane varies between 9 to 12 per cent depending on its variety.
5015. Its sucrose content begins to dry during haulage after it has been harvested from the field.
5016. Better recovery of sugar is dependent upon its being crushed within 24 hours of its harvesting.
5017. Sugar factories hence, are located within the cane producing regions.
5018. Maharashtra has emerged as a leading sugar producer in the country and produces more than one-third of the total production of the sugar in the country.
5019. Uttar Pradesh is the second largest producer of sugar.
5020. The sugar factories are concentrated in two belts – the Ganga-Yamuna doab and the tarai region.
5021. The major sugar producing centres in the Ganga -Yamuna doab are Saharanpur, Muzaffarnagar, Meerut, Ghaziabad, Baghpat and Bulandshahr districts; while Kheri Lakhimpur, Basti, Gonda, Gorakhpur, Bahraich are important sugar producing districts in the Tarai region.
5022. In Tamil Nadu, sugar factories are located in Coimbatore, Vellore, Tiruvanamalai, Villupuram and Tiruchchirappalli districts.
5023. Belagavi, Ballari, Mandya, Shivamogga, Vijayapura and Chitradurg districts are the major producers in Karnataka.
5024. The industry is distributed in the coastal regions i.e. East Godavari, West Godavari, Vishakhapatnam districts of Andhra Pradesh and Nizamabad and Medak districts of Telangana.
5025. The other States which produce sugar are Bihar, Punjab, Haryana, Madhya Pradesh and Gujarat.
5026. Saran, Champaran, Muzaffarnagar, Siwan, Darbhanga, and Gaya are the important sugarcane producing districts in Bihar.
5027. The relative significance of Punjab has declined, although Gurdaspur, Jalandhar, Sangarur, Patiala and Amritsar are major sugar producers.
5028. In Haryana, sugar factories are located in Yamuna Nagar, Rohtak, Hissar and Faridabad districts.
5029. Sugar industry is comparatively new in Gujarat.
5030. Sugar mills are located in the cane growing tracts of Surat,  junagarh, Rajkot, Amreli, Valsad and Bhavnagar districts.
5031. This group of industries has been growing very fast in India.
5032. A variety of products come under this category of industries.
5033. In 1960s, demand for organic chemicals increased so fast that it became difficult to meet this demand.
5034. At that time, petroleum refining industry expanded rapidly.
5035. Many items are derived from crude petroleum, which provide raw materials for many new industries, these are collectively known as petrochemical industries.
5036. Mumbai is the hub of the petrochemical industries.
5037. Cracker units are also located in Auraiya (Uttar Pradesh), Jamnagar, Gandhinagar and Hajira (Gujarat), Nagothane, Ratnagiri (Maharashtra), Haldia (West Bengal) and Vishakhapatnam (Andhra Pradesh).
5038. Three organisations are working in the petrochemical sector under the administrative control of the Department of Chemicals and Petrochemicals.
5039. First is the Indian Petrochemical Corporation Limited (IPCL), a public sector undertaking.
5040. It is responsible for the manufacture and distribution of the various petrochemicals like polymers, chemicals, fibres and fibre intermediates.
5041. Second is the Petrofils Cooperative Limited (PCL), a joint venture of the Government of India and Weaver’s Cooperative Societies.
5042. It produces polyester filament yarn and nylon chips at its two plants located at Vadodara and Naldhari in Gujarat.
5043. Third is the Central Institute of Plastic Engineering and Technology (CIPET), involved in imparting training in petro chemical industry.
5044. The National Organic Chemicals Industries Limited (NOCIL), established in private sector in 1961, started the first naphtha based chemical industry in Mumbai.
5045. Later, several other companies were formed.
5046. The plants located at Mumbai, Barauni, Mettur, Pimpri and Rishra are the major producers of plastic materials.
5047. About 75 per cent of these units are in small scale sector.
5048. The industry also uses recycled plastics, which constitutes about 30 per cent of the total production.
5049. Synthetic fibres are widely used in the manufacturing of fabrics because of their inherent strength, durability, washability, and resistance to shrinkage.
5050. Industries manufacturing nylon and polyester yarns are located at Kota, Pimpri, Mumbai, Modinagar, Pune, Ujjain, Nagpur and Udhna.
5051. Acrylic staple fibre is manufactured at Kota and Vadodara.
5052. Though plastics have become inseparable items in our daily use and they have affected our life style.
5053. But due to its non-biodegradable quality it has emerged as the greatest threat to our environment.
5054. Hence, use of plastic is being discouraged in different states of India.
5055. Do you know how does plastic adversely affect our environment?
5056. The advancement in information technology has  had a profound influence on the country’s economy.
5057. Indian software industry has emerged as one of the fastest growing sectors in the economy.
5058. India’s software industry has achieved a remarkable distinction for providing quality products.
5059. A large number of Indian software companies have acquired international quality certification.
5060. A majority of the multinational companies operating in the area of information technology have either software development centres or research development centres in India.
5061. A major impact of this growth has been on employment creation, which is almost doubled every year.
5062. The new Industrial Policy was announced in 1991.
5063. The major objectives of this policy were to build on the gains already made, correct the distortions or weaknesses that have crept in, maintain a sustained growth in productivity and gainful employment and attain international competitiveness.
5064. The industrial licensing system has been abolished for all except six industries related to security, strategic or environmental concerns.
5065. At the same time, the number of industries reserved for public sector since 1956 have been reduced from 17 to 4.
5066. Industries related to atomic energy, substances specified in the Schedule of the Department of Atomic Energy as well as Railways have remained under the public sector.
5067. The government also has decided to offer a part of the shareholdings in the public enterprises to financial institutions, general public and workers.
5068. The threshold limits of assets have been scrapped and no industry requires prior approval for investing in the delicensed sector.
5069. They only need to submit a memorandum in the prescribed format.
5070. In the new industrial policy, Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) has been seen as a supplement to the domestic investment for achieving a higher level of economic development.
5071. FDI benefits the domestic industry as well as the consumers by providing technological upgradation, access to global managerial skills and practices, optimum use of natural and human resources, etc.
5072. Keeping all this in mind, foreign investment has been liberalised and the government has permitted access to an automatic route for Foreign Direct Investment
5073. The government has also announced changes in the industrial location policies.
5074. Industries are discouraged in or very close to large cities due to environmental reasons.
5075. New sectors like, mining, telecommunications, highway construction and management have been thrown open to private companies. 
5076. Foreign Direct Investment has not been up to the expectation.
5077. There has been a big gap between approved and actual foreign direct investment, even though the number of foreign collaborations is increasing.
5078. Larger parts of this investment have gone to domestic appliances, finance, services, electronics and electrical equipment, and food and dairy products.
5079. Globalisation means integrating the economy of the country with the world economy.
5080. Under this process, goods and services along with capital, labour and resources can move freely from one nation to another.
5081. The thrust of globalisation has been to increase the domestic and external competition through extensive application of market mechanism and facilitating dynamic relationship with the foreign investors and suppliers of technology.
5082. Industries are not evenly distributed in the country.
5083. They tend to concentrate on certain locations because of the favourable locational factors.
5084. It extends from Mumbai-Thane to Pune and in adjoining districts of Nashik and Solapur.
5085. Besides, industrial development has been rapid in Kolaba, Ahmednagar, Satara, Sangli and Jalgaon districts.
5086. Development of this region started with the location of cotton textile industry in Mumbai.
5087. Mumbai, with cotton hinterland and moist climate favoured the location of cotton textile industry.
5088. Opening of the Suez Canal in 1869 provided impetus to the growth of Mumbai port.
5089. Machineries were imported through this port.
5090. Hydro-electricity was developed in the Western Ghat region to meet the requirements of this industry.
5091. With the development of cotton textile industry, chemical industry also developed. Opening of the Mumbai High petroleum field and erection of nuclear energy plants added additional pull to this region.
5092. Besides, engineering goods, petroleum refining, petrochemicals, leather, synthetic and plastic goods, drugs, fertilisers, electrical, shipbuilding, electronics, software, transport equipment and food industries also developed.
5093. Important industrial centres are Mumbai, Kolaba, Kalyan, Thane, T rombay, Pune, Pimpri, Nashik, Manmad, Solapur, Kolhapur, Ahmednagar, Satara and Sangli.
5094. Located along the Hugli river, this region extends from Bansberia in the north to Birlanagar in the south for a distance of about 100 km.
5095. Industries also have developed in Mednipur in the west.
5096. Kolkata-Haora from the nucleus of this industrial region.
5097. Historical, geographical, economic and political factors have contributed much to its development.
5098. It developed with the opening of river port on Hugli.
5099. Kolkata emerged as a leading centre of the country.
5100. Later, Kolkata was connected with interior parts by railway lines and road routes.
5101. Development of tea plantations in Assam and northern hills of West Bengal, the processing of indigo earlier and jute later coupled with the opening of coalfields of the Damodar Valley and iron ore deposits of the Chotanagpur plateau, contributed to the industrial development of the region. 
5102. Cheap labour available from thickly populated part of Bihar, eastern Uttar Pradesh and Odisha also contributed to its development.
5103. Kolkata, being the capital city of British India (1773-1911), attracted the British capital.
5104. The establishment of first jute mill at Rishra in 1855 ushered in the era of modern industrial clustering in this region.
5105. The major concentration of jute industry is at Haora and Bhatapara.
5106. The partition of the country in 1947 adversely affected this industrial region.
5107. Important industrial centres of this region are Kolkata, Haora, Haldia, Serampur, Rishra, Shibpur, Naihati, Kakinara, Shamnagar, Titagarh, Sodepur, Budge Budge, Birlanagar, Bansberia, Belgurriah, Triveni, Hugli, Belur, etc.
5108. However, industrial growth of this region has slowed down in comparison to other regions.
5109. Decline of the jute industry is one of the reasons.
5110. This region witnessed most rapid industrial growth in post-Independence period.
5111. Till 1960, industries were confined to Bengaluru, Salem and Madurai districts but now they have spread over all the districts of Tamil Nadu except Viluppuram.
5112. Since, this region is away from the coalfields, its development is dependent on the Pykara hydroelectric plant, which was built in 1932.
5113. Cotton textile industry was the first to take roots due to the presence of cotton growing areas.
5114. A good explanation can be done in quantitative terms.
5115. Today statistical analysis of those variables has become necessary.
5116. "For example, to study the cropping pattern of an area, the area under the crop, the productivity and production of the crop,
5117. It is essential to have statistical information about the area irrigated, the amount of rainfall and inputs such as fertilizer, pesticide and pesticide use."
5118. "Similarly, for the study of the development of a city in an area, data related to total population, 
5119. density, number of migrants, occupation of people, their salary, industries, means of transport and communication are necessary."
5120. Thus, data plays an important role in geographical analysis.
5121. You must have heard the story of a man who was traveling with his wife and five year old child.
5122. "On the way he had to cross a river.
5123. "At first he measured the depth of the four points as 0.6 0.8 0.9 1.5 m.
5124. He found the average depth to be 0.95 m.
5125. The height of her child was 1 meter.
5126. "So he took her off to cross the river and her child drowned in the river.
5127. "On the other side, he sat contemplating, there was an account, so why did the child drown?
5128. Why did the child drown when the depths were within reach of all?
5129. This is called a statistical error which can confuse you with the actual situation.
5130. "So it is very necessary to collect the data to know the facts and size, but equally important is the presentation of the data.
5131. "Today, the use of statistical methods plays an important role in almost all disciplines, including geography, that use data to analyze, present and draw conclusions.
5132. From this it can be inferred that the concentration of phenomena is found to be different.
5133. "Such as population, forest or traffic or communication network can be easily explained not only in terms of place and time but also by the use of data.
5134. "In other words you can say that there is a transfer from qualitative analysis to quantitative analysis in explaining the relationship between variables.
5135. "Hence these days analytical tools and techniques have become very important to make the subject more logical and to get precise conclusions.
5136. "From the very beginning of the collection and compilation of data, their tabulation, organization, ordering and operational analysis until the conclusion is reached. Precise: (Statistical techniques are used
5137. The data is collected by the following methods- 1. Primary hymn 2. Secondary hymn.
5138. The data which is collected for the first time individually or by a group of individuals, organization / organization, are called primary sources of data.
5139. On the other hand, the data which is collected through some published or unpublished sources are called secondary sources.
5140. Figure 1.1 shows the various methods of data collection.
5141. primary data tools
5142. It refers to the collection of information that is collected by individual or group of persons by direct observation in the field.
5143. "The characteristics of landforms, drainage patterns, soil and natural vegetation types as well as population structure, sex ratio, literacy, means of transport and communication through field surveys,
5144. Information is collected about urban and rural settlements etc.
5145. "However, while making individual observations, the person(s) involved should have a theoretical knowledge of the subject and a scientific approach for an unbiased evaluation.
5146. An accurate list of the topics to be collected by interviewing people should be prepared.
5147. The person(s) to be interviewed should have a clear idea of ​​the objectives of the survey.
5148. Before asking any sensitive question, the respondent should be taken into confidence and given the assurance that confidentiality will be maintained.
5149. There should be a conducive environment so that the respondent can explain the facts without hesitation.
5150. The language of the questions should be simple and polite so that the answerer gets inspired and readily agrees to give information related to the questions.
5151. Refrain from asking such questions so as not to hurt the self esteem or religious sentiments of the respondents.
5152. "At the end of the interview, the respondents should be asked what other information they can provide in addition to what they have already given.
5153. "They should express their thanks and gratitude for providing their valuable time for you.
5154. In this method, simple questions and their possible answers are written on a plain paper and the answerers have to mark the correct answer from the given alternatives.
5155. Sometimes a set of structural questions is written in the questionnaire and sufficient space is given to know the views of the respondents.
5156. If there is a need to collect the views of the people through open-ended questions only, then it is called questionnaire.
5157. The objectives of the survey should be clearly stated in the questionnaire.
5158. This method is useful for surveying a large area.
5159. The questionnaire can also be sent to remote areas. 
5160. The limitation of this method is that only literate and educated people can be contacted to provide the necessary information.
5161. Similar to a questionnaire, in which questions related to investigation are given, it is called a schedule.
5162. The only difference between a questionnaire and a schedule is that in the questionnaire the answerer fills the questionnaires himself, whereas in the list, the enumerator himself fills it by asking questions to the answerers.
5163. The main advantage of a schedule over a questionnaire is that information can be collected from both educated and illiterate respondents.
5164. The enumerator must be thoroughly trained to fill out multiple schedules.
5165. Soil and water properties data directly from fields, using soil kits and water quality kits.
5166. Their characteristics are measured and collected.
5167. Similarly, using field scientist to collect data about the health of crops and vegetation;
5168. Figure 1.2) Secondary sources of data Secondary sources of data include published and unpublished sources of data which include government publications, documents and reports.
5169. Publications of various Ministries and Departments of the Government of India, State Governments and District Bulletins are important sources of secondary information.
5170. These include the Census of India published by the Office of the Registrar General of India, reports of the National Sample Survey, weather reports of the Indian Meteorological Department, statistical summaries published by state governments and periodic reports published by various commissions.
5171. Some government publications are shown in Figure 1.3.
5172. Publications and reports of urban development authorities and municipal corporations and district councils of various towns and cities come under this category.
5173. Annuities under international publications, various agencies of the United Nations such as United Nations agencies, scientific and cultural organizations;
5174. Reports and monographs published by O.D. etc. are included.
5175. Some of the important UN publications that appear periodically are the Demography Year Book, the Statistical Year Book and the Human Development Report (Figure 1.4).
5176. Under this category come newspapers and yearbooks published by private organizations, survey research reports and dissertations.
5177. Newspapers and Magazines Daily newspapers and weekly, fortnightly and monthly magazines are easily accessible sources of secondary data.
5178. This stotra has emerged as an important source of secondary data through electronic media, especially the Internet.
5179. Other sources of secondary data are unpublished reports, monographs and documents.
5180. These documents are prepared and maintained in the form of unpublished records at various levels of government.
5181. For example, at the village level, the revenue records are prepared by the village patwaris which are an important source of information at the village level.
5182. In quasi-government documents, periodic reports and development plans prepared and maintained by various municipal corporations, district councils and public service departments are included.
5183. "Under this, unpublished reports and records of companies, trade unions, various political and non-political organizations and resident welfare associations are included.

5185. Tabulation and Classification of Data Data collected by primary or secondary sources initially appear as a complex set of incomprehensible information.
5186. This data structure is called a monolithic data.
5187. Those raw raw data need to be tabulated and classified in order to draw meaningful conclusions and put them into use.
5188. Statistical tables are one of the most simple ways to summarize and present data.
5189. It is a systematic arrangement of data in columns and rows.
5190. The readers get the desired information quickly from this table.
5191. "Thus tables make it possible for the analyst to present large sets of data in a single place.
5192. "Collection and Presentation of Data Data is collected, tabulated and presented in tabular form, either in absolute terms, in percentages or in index form.
5193. When data are presented in their original form as integers, they are called absolute data or integral data.
5194. "For example, total population of a country or state, total production of a crop or a manufacturing industry etc.
5195. "Table 1.1 shows the absolute population figures of India and some of its selected states.
5196. Sometimes the figures are tabulated in the form of ratios or percentages which are calculated from a common parameter, such as literacy rate or growth rate of population, percentage of agricultural products or industrial products etc.
5197. Table 1.2 Presents India's Literacy Rate in Percentage for Different Decades
5198. An index is a variable or a statistical measure designed to show the change in a related group of related variables with respect to time or geographic location or other characteristics.
5199. It is to be noted here that the index not only measures changes over time but also compares the economic conditions of different places, industries, cities or countries.
5200. The index is widely used in economics and business to look at changes in costs and quantities.
5201. There are different methods for calculating the index.
5202. Nevertheless, the simple aggregation method is the most commonly used.
5203. It is obtained by the following formula:
5204. "Normally the base year value is taken as 100 and on that basis the index is calculated.
5205. "For example, Table 1.3 shows the production of iron ore in India and the change in the indices from 1970.71 to 2000.01 with 1970.71 as the base year.
5206. In this method, the researcher receives direct information from the respondent through dialogue and interaction. Nevertheless, the interviewer should take the following precautions while conducting interviews with the people of the area-
5207. A precise list of the topics to be collected by interviewing people should be prepared.
5208. The person(s) to be interviewed should have a clear idea of ​​the objectives of the survey.
5209. Before asking any sensitive question, the respondent should be taken into confidence and assured that confidentiality will be maintained.
5210. There should be a conducive environment so that the answerer can clarify the facts without hesitation.
5211. The language of the questions should be simple and polite, so that the answerer can be inspired to easily agree to give information related to the questions.
5212. Refrain from asking such questions so as not to hurt the self esteem or religious sentiments of the respondents.
5213. At the end of the interview, the respondents should be asked what other information they can provide in addition to what they have already given.
5214. They should express their thanks and gratitude for providing their valuable time for you.
5215. Psalms and compilations.
5216. The literacy rate has been calculated as follows -
5217. An index is a variable or a statistical measure designed to show the change in a related group of related variables with respect to time or geographic location or other characteristics.
5218. It is to be noted here that the index not only measures changes over time but also compares the economic conditions of different places, industries, cities or countries.
5219. The index is widely used in economics and business to look at changes in costs and quantities.
5220. There are different methods for calculating the index.
5221. However, the simple set method is the most commonly used.
5222. It is obtained by the following formula:
5223. Usually the base year value is taken as 100 and on that basis the index is calculated.
5224. For example, Table 1.3 shows the production of iron ore in India and the change in the indices from 1970.71 to 2000.01 with 1970.71 as the base year.
5225. "Stotra - 2011 census data.
5226. data processing
5227. Processing of raw data requires their tabulation and classification into selected classes.
5228. For example, the data in Table 1.4 can be used to understand how they are processed.
5229. We can see that the given data are unclassified.
5230. Therefore, the very first step is to classify the amount of raw data by conceivable minimization.
5231. The classification of raw data involves determining the number of categories in which the raw data are classified along with their intervals.
5232. The choice of class interval and the number of classes depend on the range of the raw data and the purpose of the classification.
5233. The crude figures given in Table 1.4 range from 2 to 96.
5234. For convenience, we can put the data in ten classes with an interval of 10 units in each class.
5235. Once the number of classes and the class interval of each class are determined, a data is classified as shown in Table 1.5.
5236. This is a popular method known as core and cross method.
5237. First, for each unit of the class to which it belongs, determine a tally.
5238. For example, the first number in the raw data is 47, which falls into the square of 40.50, a tally is given in the third column of Table 1.5.
5239. In Table 1.5, we have classified the aggregate data of quantitative variables and grouped them class wise.
5240. The number of items (spaces given in the fourth column of Table 1.5) is called frequency one and the column
5241. Displays the frequency distribution.
5242. It is clear how the different items of a variable are distributed.
5243. Frequencies are classified into ordinary and cumulative frequencies.
5244. The displayed simple frequency represents the number of individuals in each class.
5245. "The sum of a given frequency for all classes represents the sum total of individual observations in the given category.
5246. "The cumulative frequency is represented by k which can be obtained by adding the given successive common frequency in each class with the first sum, as displayed in column 3 of Table 1.6.
5247. For example in Table 1.6 the first common frequency is 4.
5248. Next frequency 5 is added to 4 whose sum is 9 which is the next cumulative frequency.
5249. "Similarly each next number is added till the last cumulative frequency 60 is reached.
5250. "It is worth noting that it is equal to g or .
5251. The advantage of cumulative frequency is that one person can easily understand that there are 27 persons
5252. Whose marks are below 50 or out of 60 persons, 45 persons have marks below 70.
5253. Every common frequency belongs to its group or class.
5254. Reductive or inclusive method is used to prepare groups or classes.
5255. As shown in Table 1.6 in the first column of two numbers.
5256. Note that the upper limit of one class is the same as the lower limit of the next.
5257. For example one class A;20-30 has a higher limit of 30 while the next classA;30-40 has a lower limit.
5258. 30 are displayed in both the squares.
5259. But any observation whose value is 30 is placed in the class in which it falls on the lower limit and is removed from the class in which it lies at the higher limit (20-30).
5260. That's why this method is called refractive method.
5261. Now you can know where all the marginal values ​​in Table 1.4 will go.
5262. Its classes are explained in the following way -
5263. 0 and below 10 10 and below 20
5264. Below 20 and 30 Below 30 and 40
5265. Below 40 and 50 Below 50 and 60
5266. Below 60 and 70 Below 70 and 80
5267. Below 80 and 90 Below 90 and 100
5268. In this type of grouping, the range expands to 10 units.
5269. For example, the numbers 20 to 29 come in the third category.
5270. In this method a value which is equal to the value of the upper limit of the class is placed in that class.
5271. That is why this method is called inclusive method.
5272. In this method the classes are represented differently as shown in the first column of Table 1.7.
5273. Generally, there is a difference of 1 in the upper limit of a class from the lower limit of the next class.
5274. The important thing is that in this method also the class expands to 10 units.
5275. For example, the square of 50-59 is 10 values ​​50, to 59;
5276. Table 1.7 includes integration.
5277. In this method both the high and low limits are incorporated to obtain the frequency distribution.
5278. The graph of the frequency distribution is known as the frequency polygon.
5279. It helps in the comparison of two or more frequency distributions.
5280. The two frequencies are shown by bar diagram and diagram.
5281. Practical Work in Geography, Part-2
5282. Table 1.6: Frequency Distribution: Inclusive Method
5283. Fig. 1.5: Frequency Distribution Polygons In this type of grouping, the range extends up to 10 units.
5284. For example, the numbers 20 to 29 come in the third category.
5285. In this method a value which is equal to the value of the upper limit of the class is placed in that class.
5286. That is why this method is called inclusive method.
5287. In this method the classes are represented differently as shown in the first column of Table 1.7.
5288. Generally, there is a difference of 1 in the upper limit of a class from the lower limit of the next class.
5289. The important thing is that in this method also the class expands to 10 units.
5290. For example, class A of 50–59 contains the 10 values ​​50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58 and 59 (Table 1.7).
5291. In this method both high and low limits are incorporated to obtain the frequency distribution.
5292. The graph of the frequency distribution is known as the frequency polygon.
5293. It helps in the comparison of two or more frequency distributions.
5294. The two frequencies are shown by bar diagram and diagram.
5295. When the frequencies are added up, they are called cumulative frequencies and are listed in the table,
5296. "It is called cumulative table."
5297. The curve obtained by cumulative frequency is called Ogive which is pronounced Ojive.
5298. Its construction is either a lesser method; a whole lot of life or a mostly method;
5299. Uvatam Jind by Umjeevkad.
5300. In the lower method, we start with the higher range of the ranges and keep adding to the frequency. 
5301. When these frequencies are plotted, we get a rising curve as shown in Table 1.8 and Figure 1.5.
5302. In most method, we start with the lower limit of classes and count each class by the cumulative frequency.
5303. "decrease the frequency. When these frequencies are recorded, we get a descending curve as shown in Table 1.9 and Fig. 1.6.
5304. One can combine both the above two images 1.5 and 1.6 to get a comparative picture of less Ogive and higher Ogive as shown in Table 1.10 and Figure 1.7.
5305. You know that the computers enhance our capabilities in data processing and in drawing graphs, diagrams and maps (Refer to Chapter 4 of the present book).
5306. The disciplines that deals with the principles and methods of data processing and mapping using a combination of computer hardware and the application software are referred as the Database Management System (DBMS) and the Computer Assisted Cartography, respectively. However, the role of such computer applications is restricted to merely processing of the data and their graphical presentation.
5307. In other words, the data so processed or the maps and diagrams so prepared could not be used to evolve a decision support system.
5308. As a matter of fact, there are several questions that we normally encounter in our day-to-day life and look for satisfactory solutions.
5309. These questions may be: What  is where ?
5310. Why is it there ?
5311. What will happen if it is shifted to a new location?
5312. Who will be benefited by such a reallocation?
5313. Who are expected to loose the benefits if reallocation takes place?
5314. In order to, understand these and many other questions, we need to capture the necessary data collected from different sources and integrate them using a computer that is supported by geo-processing tools.
5315. Herein lays the concept of a Spatial Information System.
5316. In the present chapter, we will discuss basic principles of the Spatial Information Technology and its extension to the Spatial Information System, which is more commonly known as Geographical Information System.
5317. What is Spatial Information Technology?
5318. The word spatial is derived from space.
5319. It refers to the features and the phenomena distributed over a geographically definable space, thus, having physically measurable dimensions.
5320. We know that most data that are used today have spatial components (location), such as an address of a municipal facility, or the boundaries of an agricultural holdings, etc.
5321. Hence, the Spatial Information Technology relates to the use of the technological inputs in collecting, storing, retrieving, displaying, manipulating, managing and analysing the spatial information.
5322. It is an amalgamation of Remote Sensing, GPS, GIS, Digital Cartography and Database Management Systems.
5323. What is GIS (Geographical Information System)?
5324. The advance computing systems available since mid 1970’s enable the processing of georeferenced information for the purpose of organising spatial and attribute data and their integration; locating specific information in individual files and executing the computations, performing analysis and evolving a decision support system.
5325. A system capable of all such functions is called Geographic Information System
5326. It is defined as A system for capturing, storing, checking, integrating, manipulating, analysing and displaying data, which are spatially referenced to the Earth.
5327. As discussed in Chapter 4, two types of the data represent the geographical information. These are spatial and non – spatial data (Box 6.1).
5328. The spatial data are characterised by their positional, linear and areal forms of appearances
5329. A database contains attributes and their value or class.
5330. The non-spatial data on the left display cycle parts, which can be located anywhere.
5331. The data record on the right is spatial because one of the attributes, the name of different states, which have a definite locations in a map.
5332. This data can be used in GIS.
5333. These data forms must be geometrically registered to a generally accepted and properly defined coordinate system and coded so that they can be stored in the internal database structure of GIS.
5334. On the other hand, the data those describe the spatial data are called as Non–spatial or attribute data.
5335. The spatial data are the most important pre-requisite in a spatial or geographical information system.
5336. In a GIS core, it could be built in several ways.
5337. Acquire data in digital form from a data supplier
5338. Digitise existing analogue data
5339. Carry out one’s own surveys of geographic entities.
5340. The choice of a source of geographical data for a GIS application is, however, largely governed by :
5341. The type of data structure, i.e., vector/raster. For many users, the most common source of spatial data is topographical or thematic maps in hard copy (paper) or soft copy form (digital).
5342. All such maps are characterised by :
5343. A definite scale which provides relationship between the map and the surface it represents,
5344. Use of symbols and colours which define attributes of entities mapped, and
5345. An agreed coordinate system, which defines the location of entities on the Earth’s surface.
5346. The maps, irrespective of a graphic medium of communication of geographic information and possessing geometric fidelity, are inherited with the following limitations :
5347. Map information is processed and presented in a particular way.
5348. A map shows a single or more than one predetermined themes.
5349. The alteration of the information depicted on the maps require a new map to be drawn.
5350. Contrarily, a GIS possesses inherent advantages of separate data storage and presentation.
5351. It also provides options for viewing and presenting the data in several ways.
5352. The following advantages of a GIS are worth mentioning :
5353. Users can interrogate displayed spatial features and retrieve associated attribute information for analysis.
5354. Maps can be drawn by querying or analysing attribute data.
5355. Spatial operations (polygon overlay or buffering) can be applied on integrated database to generate new sets of information.
5356. Different items of attribute data can be associated with one another through shared location code.
5357. As discussed in Chapter 4 the GIS has three major components :
5358. Hardware comprising the processing, storage, display, and input and output sub-systems.
5359. Software modules for data entry, editing, maintenance, analysis, transformation, manipulation, data display and output.
5360. An application software with the following functional modules is important prerequisite of a GIS
5361. Software related to data entry, editing and maintenance
5362. Software related to analysis/transformation/manipulation
5363. Software related to data display and output.
5364. Spatial data and related tabular data are the backbone of GIS.
5365. The existing data may be acquired from a supplier or a new data may be created/collected in-house by the user.
5366. The digital map forms the basic data input for GIS.
5367. Tabular data related to the map objects can also be attached to the digital data.
5368. A GIS will integrate spatial data with other data resources and can even use a DBMS.
5369. Procedures include how the data will be retrieved, input into the system,stored managed, transformed, analysedand finally presented ina final output.
5370. GIS users have a wide range from hardware and software engineers to resources and environmental scientists, policy-makers, and the monitoring and implementing agencies.
5371. These cross-section of people use GIS to evolve a decision support system and solve real time problems.
5372. Raster data represent a graphic feature as a pattern of grids of squares, whereas vector data represent the object as a set of lines drawn between specific points.
5373. Consider a line drawn diagonally on a piece of paper.
5374. A raster file would represent this imageby sub-dividing thepaper into a matrix of small rectangles,similar to a sheet of graph paper called cells.Each cell is assigned a position in the data file and given a value based on the attribute at that position. it row and column coordinates may identify any individual pixel
5375. This data representation allows the user to easily reconstruct or visualise the original image.
5376. The relationship between cell size and the number of cells is expressed as the resolution of the raster. 
5377. The effect of grid size on data in raster format is explained
5378. The effect of grid size on data in raster format is explained in Fig. 6.4.
5379. in Fig. 6.4 The Raster file formats are most often used for the following activities :
5380. For digital representations of aerial photographs, satellite images, scanned paper maps, etc.
5381. When costs need to be kept down.
5382. When the map does not require analysis of individual map features.
5383. When “backdrop” maps are required.
5384. A vector representation of the same diagonal line would record the position of the line by simply recording the coordinates of its starting and ending points.
5385. Each point would be expressed as two or three numbers
5386. depending on whether the representation was 2D or 3D, often referred to as X,Y or X,Y,Z coordinates)
5387. The first number, X, is the distance between the point and the left side of the paper; Y, the distance between the point and the bottom of the paper; Z, the point’s elevation above or below the paper.
5388. Joining the measured points forms the vector.
5389. A vector data model uses points stored by their real (earth) coordinates.
5390. Here lines and areas are built from sequences of points in order.
5391. Lines have a direction to the ordering of the points. 
5392. Polygons can be built from points or lines.
5393. Vectors can store information about topology.
5394. Manual digitising is the best way of vector data input.
5395. The Vector files are most often used for :
5396. Highly precise applications
5397. When file sizes are important
5398. When individual map features require analysis
5399. When descriptive information must be stored
5400. The advantages and the disadvantages of the raster and vector data formats are explained 
5401. These could be summarised into the following two categories :
5402. The present day data supplies make the digital data readily available, which range from small-scale maps to the large-scale plans.
5403. For many local governments and private organisations, such data form an essential source and keep such groups of users free from overheads of digitising or collecting their own data.
5404. Although, using such existing data sets is attractive and time saving, serious attention must be paid to data compatibility when data from different sources supplies are combined in one project.
5405. The differences in terms of projection, scale, base level and description in attributes may cause problems.
5406. At a practical level, users must consider the following characteristics of the data to ensure that they are compatible with the application:
5407. It must also be noted that where data are used from a number of sources, and particularly where the area of study crosses administrative boundaries, the difficulties in data integration are caused by different geographical referencing systems, data classification and sampling.
5408. Hence, the user needs to be aware of these problems, which are particularly prone when compiling inter-province, and inter-district data sets.
5409. Once, the compatibility between the data acquired from different suppliers is established, the next stage involves the transfer of data from a medium of transfer to the GIS.
5410. The use of DAT tapes, CD ROMS and floppy disks is becoming increasingly common for the purpose. 
5411. At this stage, the  conversion from encoding and structuring system of the source to that of GIS to be used is important.
5412. The manual data input methods depend on whether the database has a vector topology or grid cell (raster) structure.
5413. The most common ways of inputting spatial data in to a GIS are through
5414. With the entity model, geographical data are in the form of points, lines and/ or polygons (areas)/pixels which are defined using a series of coordinates.
5415. These are obtained by referring to the geographical referencing systems of the map or aerial photograph, or by overlaying a graticule or grid onto it.
5416. The use of digitisers and the scanners greatly reduce the time and labour involved in writing down coordinates.
5417. We shall, briefly, discuss how the spatial data are created in GIS core using a scanner.
5418. Scanners are the devices for converting analogue data into digital grid-based images.
5419. They are used in spatial data capture to convert a line map to high-resolution raster images which may be used directly or further processed to get vector topology.
5420. There are two basic types of scanners
5421. The first type of scanners incorporates a source of illumination on a movable arm (usually light emitting diodes or a stabilised fluorescent lamp) and a digital camera with high-resolution lamp.
5422. These are semi-conductor devices that translate the photons of light falling on their surface into counts of electrons, which are then recorded as a digital value.
5423. The camera is usually equipped with special sensors called Charged Coupled Devices (CCDs) arranged in an array.
5424. The movement of either the scanner or the map builds up a digital two-dimensional image of the map.
5425. The map to be scanned can be mounted either on a flat bed, or on a rotating drum.
5426. With flatbed scanners, the light source is moved systematically up and down over the surface of the document.
5427. For large maps, scanners are used which are mounted on a stand and the illumination source and camera array are fixed in a position.
5428. The map is moved past by a feeding mechanism. Modern document scanners resemble laser printers in reverse because the scanning surface is manufactured with a given resolution of light sensitive spots that can be directly addressed by the software.
5429. There are no moving parts except a movable light source.
5430. The resolution is determined by the geometry of the sensor surface and the amount of memory rather than by a mechanical arm.
5431. The scanned image is always far from perfect even with the best possible scanners, as it contains all the smudges and defects of the original map.
5432. The excess data, therefore, in a digital image must be removed to make it usable.
5433. Attribute data define the properties of a spatial entity that need to be handled in the GIS, but which are not spatial.
5434. For example, a road may be captured as a set of contiguous pixels or as a line entity and represented in the spatial part of the GIS by a certain colour, symbol or data location.
5435. The attribute values associated with the road, such as road width, type of surface, estimated number of traffic and specific traffic regulation may also be stored separately
5436. Information describing the type of road may be included in the range of cartographic symbols.
5437. either as spatial information in the GIS in case of relational databases, or input along with spatial description with the object-oriented data bases.
5438. The spatial data captured into a GIS require verification for the error identification and corrections so as to ensure the data accuracy.
5439. he errors caused during digitisation may include data omissions, and under/over shoots.
5440. The best way to check for errors in the spatial data is to produce a computer plot or print of the data, preferably on translucent sheet, at the same scale as the original.
5441. The two maps may then be placed over each other on a light table and compared visually, working systematically from left to right and top to bottom of the map.
5442. Missing data and locational errors should be clearly marked on the printout.
5443. The errors that may arise during the capturing of spatial and attribute data may be grouped as under
5444. The incompleteness in the spatial data arises through omissions in the input of points, lines, or polygons/area of manually entered data.
5445. In scanned data the omissions are usually in the form of gaps between lines where the raster vector conversion process has failed to join up all parts of a line.
5446. The digitising at the wrong scale produces input spatial data at a wrong scale.
5447. In scanned data, the problems usually arise during the geo-referencing process when incorrect values are used.
5448. The spatial data may also be distorted if the base maps used for digitising are not scale correct.
5449. The aerial photographs, in particular, are characterised by incorrect scale because of the lens distortions, relief and till displacements.
5450. In addition, paper maps and field documents used for scanning or digitising may contain random distortions as a result of having been exposed to rain, sunshine and frequent folding.
5451. Hence, transformation from one coordinate system to another may be needed if the coordinate system of the database is different from that used in the input document or image.
5452. These errors need corrections through various editing and updating functions as supported directly by most GIS software.
5453. The process is time-consuming and interactive that can take longer time than the data input itself.
5454. The data editing is usually undertaken by viewing the portion of map containing the errors on the computer screen and correcting them through the software using the keyboard, screen cursor controlled by a mouse or a small digitiser tablet.
5455. Minor locational errors in a vector database may be corrected by moving the spatial entity through the screen cursor.
5456. In some GIS, computer commands may be used directly to move, rotate, erase, insert, stretch or truncate the graphical entities are required.
5457. Where excess coordinates define a line these may be removed using ‘weeding’ algorithms. Attribute values and spatial errors in raster data
5458. Attribute values and spatial errors in raster data must be corrected by changing the value of the faulty cells.
5459. once, the spatial errors have been corrected, the topology of vector line and polygon networks can be generated.
5460. While manipulating and analysing data, the same format should be used for all data. When different layers are to be used simultaneously, they should all be invector or all in raster format.
5461. Usually, the conversion is from vector to raster, because the biggest part of the analysis is done in the raster domain.
5462. Vector data are transformed to raster data by overlaying a grid with a user-defined cell size.
5463. Sometimes, the data in the raster format are converted into vector format.
5464. This is the case especially if one wants to achieve data reduction because the data storage needed for raster data are much larger than for vector data.
5465. The linkages of spatial and the attribute data are important in GIS.
5466. It must, therefore, carefully be undertaken.
5467. Linking of attribute data with a non-related spatial data shall lead to chaos in ultimate data analysis.
5468. Similarly, matching of one data layer with another is also significant.
5469. A GIS typically links different data sets.
5470. Suppose, we want to know the mortality rate due to malnutrition among children under 10 years of age in any state.
5471. If we have one file that contains the number of children in this age group, and another that contains the mortality rate from malnutrition, we must first combine or link the two data files.
5472. Once this is done, we can divide one figure by the other to obtain the desired answer.
5473. Exact matching means when we have information in one computer file about many geographic features (e.g., towns) and additional information in another file about the same set of features.
5474. Thus, the record in each file with the same town name is extracted, and the two are joined and stored in another file.
5475. Buffer operation is another important spatial analysis function in GIS.
5476. A buffer of a certain specified distance can be created along any point, line or area feature
5477. It is useful in locating the areas/population benefitted or denied of the facilities and services, such as hospitals, medical stores, post office, asphalt roads, regional parks, etc.
5478. Similarly, it can also be used to study the impact of point sources of air, noise or water pollution on human health and the size of the population so affected.
5479. This kind of analysis is called proximity analysis.
5480. The buffer operation will generate polygon feature types irrespective of geographic features and delineates spatial proximity.
5481. For example, numbers of household living within one-kilometre buffer from a chemical industrial unit are affected by industrial waste discharged from the unit.
5482. Arc View/ArcGIS, Geomedia Quantum GIS free opensoftware and all other GIS softwares provide modules for buffer analysis along point, line and area features.
5483. For example, by using appropriate commands of either of the available software, one can create buffers of 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10 kilometres around the cities having a major hospital located.
5484. As a case study, point location of Saharanpur,Muzaffarnagar, Meerut, Ghaziabad, Gautam Budh Nagar and Aligarh has been mapped 
5485. Fig. 6.12) and the buffer have been created from the cities where major hospitals are found.
